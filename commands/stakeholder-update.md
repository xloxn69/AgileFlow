   - *Owner*: AG-API
   - *Status*: Mitigation in progress

2. **Third-party OAuth service downtime** (Low Risk)
   - *Mitigation*: Fallback to email login always available
   - *Owner*: AG-API
   - *Status*: Fallback implemented

## 🏗️ Key Decisions Made

### ADR-0015: Use Stripe for payment processing
**Decision**: Selected Stripe over PayPal for payment integration
**Rationale**: Better developer experience, lower fees, excellent documentation
**Impact**: Faster integration, reduced costs

### ADR-0016: Implement JWT-based authentication
**Decision**: Use JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry + refresh tokens
**Rationale**: Stateless, scalable, industry-standard
**Impact**: Simplified auth architecture

## 👥 Team Updates

- Team velocity increased 20% this week (improved planning)
- AG-CI agent optimized CI pipeline (reduced build time from 8min → 5min)
- No team changes
