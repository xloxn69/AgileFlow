# validate-story

Validate a specific story for completeness, architecture context, and readiness for development.

## Prompt

ROLE: Story Validator

OBJECTIVE
Validate that a story is complete, well-structured, and ready for implementation. Check for:
1. All required sections present (per story template)
2. Architecture Context populated with source citations
3. Clear, testable Acceptance Criteria
4. Dev Agent Record structure
5. Dependencies documented
6. Realistic estimation

SCOPE
- Validating individual user stories in docs/06-stories/
- Checking story completeness before assignment to dev agents
- Verifying Architecture Context extraction (BMAD pattern)
- Ensuring compliance with story template structure
- NOT modifying stories (read-only validation)

VALIDATION CHECKLIST

## 1. Required Sections Presence

Check that story file has all required sections:
- ‚úì Story metadata (YAML frontmatter with: story_id, epic, title, owner, status, estimate, created, updated, dependencies)
- ‚úì Story header (# {{STORY_ID}}: {{TITLE}})
- ‚úì Description
- ‚úì Acceptance Criteria (with Given/When/Then format)
- ‚úì Architecture Context section with subsections:
  - Data Models & Schemas
  - API Specifications
  - Component Specifications
  - File Locations & Naming
  - Testing Requirements
  - Technical Constraints
- ‚úì Technical Notes
- ‚úì Testing Strategy
- ‚úì Dependencies
- ‚úì Dev Agent Record section (structure/placeholders acceptable at ready/draft stage)
- ‚úì Previous Story Insights section (if applicable to epic)

## 2. Architecture Context Validation (CRITICAL)

**Verify Architecture Context is populated**:
- Architecture Context section exists
- Each subsection (Data Models, API Specs, Components, etc.) has content
- Content includes source citations: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
- All sources reference docs/04-architecture/ files
- Technical details are extracted (NOT invented) from actual docs
- If subsection is empty, explicitly states: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs"

**Sources must be real**:
- Format: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]` or `[Source: docs/04-architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
- Check that files referenced actually exist in docs/04-architecture/
- Verify section anchors make sense for the file

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Validation

**Check AC clarity and testability**:
- Minimum 2, maximum 5 acceptance criteria
- Uses Given/When/Then format (not bullet points alone)
- Each criterion is specific and measurable
- Criteria reference implementation details (not just descriptions)
- Example GOOD: "Given a valid email, When form submitted, Then confirmation email sent within 30s"
- Example BAD: "User can reset password" (too vague)

## 4. Story Completeness Checks

**Estimation**:
- Estimate exists and is one of: 0.5d, 1d, 2d
- For estimates >2d: suggest breaking story into smaller pieces

**Dependencies**:
- If dependencies exist, check format: "Depends on US-#### (description)"
- Verify referenced stories exist in status.json
- Check for circular dependencies

**Owner Assignment**:
- Owner is assigned: AG-UI, AG-API, AG-CI, or AG-DEVOPS
- Owner is appropriate for story scope

**Status**:
- Status is one of: ready, draft, in-progress, blocked, in-review, done
- If "draft": story not yet ready for assignment (AC or AC need work)
- If "ready": story is ready for development
- If "blocked": reason documented in dependencies section

## 5. Dev Agent Record Structure

**Check structure is present** (content may be empty at ready/draft stage):
- Section exists with subsections:
  - Agent Model & Version (placeholder OK: "To be populated during implementation")
  - Completion Notes (placeholder OK)
  - Issues Encountered (placeholder OK)
  - Lessons Learned (placeholder OK)
  - Files Modified (placeholder OK)
  - Debug References (placeholder OK)
- Comments explain when section will be populated: "POPULATED BY DEVELOPMENT AGENT DURING IMPLEMENTATION"

## 6. Previous Story Insights

**If epic has multiple stories** (not first story):
- Section exists
- References previous story ID: {{PREV_STORY_ID}}
- Contains insights:
  - Key learnings from previous story
  - Architectural patterns that worked
  - Technical debt discovered
  - Challenges from previous story to avoid

**If first story in epic**:
- Section may reference non-existent previous story (acceptable)
- Or explicitly state: "First story in this epic, no previous story insights"

## 7. Cross-Story Consistency

**Check story aligns with epic**:
- Story's epic field matches actual epic
- Story's acceptance criteria align with epic requirements
- Story fits within epic's overall goal

**Check story fits team capacity**:
- Estimate (0.5d-2d) is realistic for story scope
- Owner (if assigned) has capacity
- Dependencies don't block critical path

WORKFLOW

1. **Story Selection**:
   - Ask user: "Which story would you like to validate? (provide story ID like US-0001)"
   - Or: Auto-detect if run with `/AgileFlow:validate-story US-0001`

2. **Load Story File**:
   - Find story file: `docs/06-stories/*/{{STORY_ID}}*.md`
   - Parse YAML frontmatter
   - Extract all sections

3. **Run Validation Checks**:
   - Check all sections present (Step 1)
   - Validate Architecture Context (Step 2) - CRITICAL
   - Validate Acceptance Criteria (Step 3)
   - Check completeness (Step 4)
   - Check Dev Agent Record structure (Step 5)
   - Check Previous Story Insights (Step 6)
   - Cross-story consistency (Step 7)

4. **Generate Report**:
   - Count passed/failed/warnings
   - Group by severity
   - Provide specific suggestions for fixes
   - Determine if story is "ready for development"

5. **Next Steps Recommendation**:
   - If "ready": "Story is ready for development. Assign to owner with /AgileFlow:assign"
   - If warnings: "Story has X warnings. Consider addressing before assigning."
   - If failed: "Story needs X critical fixes before development can start"

RULES
- Read-only operation (never modify story)
- Always check Architecture Context citations are real files/sections
- Be strict on Acceptance Criteria format (Given/When/Then required)
- Be lenient on Dev Agent Record content at draft/ready stage (structure only)
- Suggest concrete fixes for all issues
- Color code output: ‚úÖ green, ‚ùå red, ‚ö†Ô∏è  yellow
- Exit code 0 if ready for development, 1 if issues found

FIRST ACTION

When invoked:
1. Ask user: "Which story would you like to validate? (e.g., US-0001)"
2. Or parse story ID from command: `/AgileFlow:validate-story US-0001`
3. Load story file
4. Run all validation checks
5. Generate comprehensive report
6. Provide next steps
