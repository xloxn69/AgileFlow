# velocity

Track team velocity, calculate trends, and forecast completion dates.

## Prompt

ROLE: Velocity Analyst & Forecaster

OBJECTIVE
Calculate team velocity from completed stories, identify trends, and forecast epic/milestone completion dates.

INPUTS (optional)
- PERIOD=week|sprint|month|all (default: sprint - last 2 weeks)
- FORECAST=<EPIC_ID or milestone> (predict completion date)
- FORMAT=report|chart|json (default: report)

DATA SOURCES

1. **Story Completion Data**
   - docs/09-agents/status.json (current state)
   - docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl (historical status changes)
   - docs/06-stories/**/US-*.md (story estimates and metadata)

2. **Epic/Milestone Data**
   - docs/05-epics/*.md (epic definitions)
   - docs/08-project/milestones.md (milestone targets)

VELOCITY CALCULATION

### Story Points Completed
Parse bus/log.jsonl for status changes to "done":
```json
{"ts":"2025-10-10T10:00:00Z","type":"status","story":"US-0030","status":"done"}
{"ts":"2025-10-11T14:30:00Z","type":"status","story":"US-0031","status":"done"}
```

For each story, get estimate from story file frontmatter:
```yaml
estimate: 1.5d
```

Convert to points (1d = 1 point) and sum by time period.

### Velocity Calculation
```
Velocity = Total points completed / Number of time periods
```

Example:
- Week 1: 8 points
- Week 2: 10 points
- Week 3: 7 points
- **Average velocity**: (8+10+7)/3 = **8.3 points/week**

**Weekly Breakdown**:
| Week | Points | Stories | Avg Size | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| 2025-10-14 | 10 | 6 | 1.7d | ↗️ +25% |
| 2025-10-07 | 8  | 5 | 1.6d | ↗️ +14% |
| 2025-09-30 | 7  | 4 | 1.8d | ↘️ -30% |

| 2025-09-09 | 10 | 6 | 1.7d | - |

**Insights**:
- Velocity is trending upward (+15% over 6 weeks)
- Best performance when story size ≤1.5d
- Week of 2025-09-23 had highest throughput (7 stories)
- Consistency improving (std dev: 2.1 → 1.8)

## 👥 Velocity by Owner

| Owner | Points/Week | Stories/Week | Utilization | Trend |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| AG-UI | 3.2 | 2.1 | 80% | ↗️ +10% |
| AG-API | 4.1 | 2.8 | 85% | ↗️ +20% |
| AG-CI | 0.8 | 0.6 | 40% | → Stable |
| AG-DEVOPS | 0.2 | 0.2 | 10% | 🆕 New |

**Observations**:
- AG-API is the team workhorse (4.1 pts/wk)
- AG-CI underutilized (consider more stories)
- AG-DEVOPS just started (too early for trends)

## ⚠️ Risk Analysis

### Velocity Risks
1. **AG-API dependency**: 50% of points from one agent
   - *Mitigation*: Cross-train, pair programming
2. **Story size variance**: Some 2d stories slow velocity
   - *Mitigation*: Split stories >1.5d
3. **Seasonal slowdown**: Historical dip in Week 5
   - *Mitigation*: Add buffer to forecasts

### Schedule Risks
- EP-0011 blocking Milestone: Public Beta
- If velocity drops 20% → Beta delayed to 2025-11-12
- If AG-API unavailable → 50% velocity loss

---

## 📅 Capacity Planning

**Current Capacity**: 8.3 points/week (4 agents)

**Recommendations**:
1. **This Sprint** (2 weeks):
   - Plan: 16-18 points (2x velocity)
   - Buffer: Keep 2-3 ready stories
   - Focus: Complete EP-0010

2. **Next Sprint**:
   - Plan: 16-20 points
   - Priority: EP-0011 (Beta blocker)
   - Consider: Add stories for AG-CI (underutilized)

3. **Long-term**:
   - Maintain 8-10 points/week sustained velocity
   - Reserve 20% for tech debt (/AgileFlow:tech-debt command)
   - Keep story sizes ≤1.5d for predictability

---

## 🎯 Velocity Goals

**Current**: 8.3 points/week
**Target**: 10 points/week (by end of quarter)
**Stretch**: 12 points/week

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Split 2 large stories (US-0050, US-0051)
- [ ] Assign 2 more stories to AG-CI
- [ ] Review blockers (US-0041)
- [ ] Celebrate hitting 10 pts/wk milestone! 🎉

FORECASTING ALGORITHM

### Simple Linear Forecast
```
Days to complete = (Remaining points / Velocity) * 7
Completion date = Today + Days to complete
```

### Confidence Calculation
```
Confidence = 100% - (Velocity std dev / Velocity avg) * 100

High confidence: >80% (stable velocity)
Medium: 60-80% (some variance)
Low: <60% (high variance, unreliable)
```

### Monte Carlo Simulation (optional, advanced)
Run 1000 simulations with velocity variance:
```
For each simulation:
  - Sample velocity from normal distribution (mean, std dev)
  - Calculate completion date
  - Record result

Forecast:
  - P50 (median): 50% chance of completing by this date
  - P80: 80% chance
  - P90: 90% chance (conservative estimate)
```

VELOCITY BY STORY SIZE

```
Velocity by Story Size

Size    | Count | Avg Days | Success Rate
--------|-------|----------|-------------
≤0.5d   |   8   |   0.4d   | 100% ✅
0.5-1d  |  12   |   0.9d   |  92% ✅
1-1.5d  |  10   |   1.3d   |  80% ⚠️
1.5-2d  |   6   |   2.1d   |  67% ⚠️
>2d     |   3   |   3.5d   |  33% 🔴

**Insight**: Stories ≤1d complete faster and more reliably.
**Recommendation**: Split stories >1.5d into smaller increments.

WORKFLOW

1. Parse bus/log.jsonl for "done" status changes
2. Match stories to estimates from frontmatter
3. Group completions by time period (week/sprint)
4. Calculate velocity stats (avg, trend, std dev)
5. If FORECAST specified:
   - Calculate remaining points
   - Apply velocity to forecast completion
   - Calculate confidence level
6. Render report/chart
7. Suggest actions based on findings

INTEGRATION

- Save velocity history to docs/08-project/velocity/
- Update /AgileFlow:stakeholder-update with velocity data
- Alert if velocity drops >20% from average
- Suggest sprint planning capacity based on velocity

RULES
- Always calculate over at least 3 time periods (for reliability)
- Warn if sample size too small (<5 stories)
- Exclude outliers (stories >3x avg) from velocity calc
- Account for holidays/time off in forecasts
- Update forecast confidence based on variance

OUTPUT
- Velocity report (markdown/chart/json)
- Trend analysis
- Forecasts for epics/milestones
- Risk analysis
- Action items
