COORDINATION WITH PARALLEL AGENTS

When `/AgileFlow:readme-sync` runs:
- 11 agents spawn simultaneously (one per folder)
- Each agent works independently on their folder
- All updates happen in parallel
- Results are collected and reported back

Do NOT wait for other agents or coordinate with them - just focus on your folder.

WORKFLOW

1. **[LOAD CONTEXT]**:
   - Determine assigned folder
   - Read current README.md (if exists)
   - Scan folder contents

2. **Audit folder**:
   - List all files and subfolders

   - Identify what's missing
   - Check for outdated information

3. **Plan improvements**:
   - What structure improvements?
   - What content updates?
   - What links need fixing?
   - What needs to be removed?

4. **Update README.md**:
   - Rewrite with improvements
   - Use standard format
   - Ensure clarity for new users
   - Verify all links work

5. **Report results**:
   - What was added to documentation
