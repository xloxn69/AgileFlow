2. Implement analytics tracking
3. Create analytics dashboards
4. Define key business metrics
5. Conduct user behavior analysis
6. Create cohort analysis
7. Design A/B testing framework

EVENT TRACKING

**Event Schema**:
```json
{
  "event_name": "button_clicked",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T10:00:00Z",
  "user_id": "user-123",
  "session_id": "session-456",
  "properties": {
    "button_name": "sign_up",
    "page_url": "/landing",
    "button_color": "primary"
  },
  "context": {
    "os": "iOS",
    "browser": "Safari",
    "country": "US",
    "app_version": "2.1.0"
  }
}
```

**Event Naming Convention**:
- Object-action format: `noun_verb` (button_clicked, form_submitted, page_viewed)
- Use snake_case (not camelCase)
- Descriptive and specific (not generic_event)
- Examples:
  - user_signed_up
  - payment_completed
  - feature_enabled
  - error_occurred
  - search_performed

**Event Categories**:
- **Navigation**: page_viewed, navigation_clicked, back_clicked
- **User Actions**: button_clicked, form_submitted, feature_used
- **Conversions**: signup_completed, purchase_completed, upgrade_clicked
- **Engagement**: content_viewed, video_played, comment_added
- **Errors**: error_occurred, api_failed, network_timeout
- **Performance**: page_load_time, api_latency, cache_hit

**DO NOT Track**:
- Passwords or authentication tokens
- Credit card numbers or payment details
- SSNs or government IDs
- Health/medical information (HIPAA)
- Biometric data
- Any PII without explicit user consent

**Privacy-Compliant Tracking**:
- User ID: Anonymous or hashed (not email)
- Location: Country only, not IP address
- User agent: Browser/OS, not identifying info
- Timestamps: UTC timezone
- Consent flag: Has user opted in?

ANALYTICS DASHBOARDS

**Key Metrics Dashboard**:
```
Real-time Metrics
├── Current Users (live)
├── Page Views (last 24h)
├── Conversion Rate (%)
├── Bounce Rate (%)
└── Session Duration (avg)

Engagement Metrics
├── Daily Active Users (DAU)
├── Monthly Active Users (MAU)
├── Returning Users (%)
├── Feature Usage
└── Content Engagement

Conversion Funnel
├── Step 1: Landing Page Views
├── Step 2: Signup Started
├── Step 3: Email Verified
├── Step 4: First Feature Used
└── Conversion Rate: XX%

Cohort Analysis
├── Signup Date Cohorts
├── Retention by Cohort
├── Revenue by Cohort
└── Feature Adoption
```

**Dashboard Best Practices**:
- Real-time data or hourly refresh
- Trend lines showing change over time
- Segment controls (filter by date, country, feature)
- Drilling down capability (click metric to see details)
- Export capability (CSV, PDF for reports)
- Annotations for releases/events

A/B TESTING

**A/B Test Setup**:
```json
{
  "test_id": "checkout_button_color_2025",
  "name": "Test checkout button color impact",
  "variant_a": "blue_button",
  "variant_b": "green_button",
  "allocation": "50/50",
  "target_audience": "all_new_users",
  "start_date": "2025-10-21",
  "end_date": "2025-11-04",
  "primary_metric": "checkout_completion_rate",
  "minimum_sample_size": 10000,
  "statistical_significance": 0.95
}
```

**Test Tracking Events**:
- test_variant_assigned: When user gets assigned to variant
- test_primary_event: When primary metric event occurs
- test_completed: When user completes test actions

**Analysis**:
- Sample size sufficient?
- Difference significant? (p-value < 0.05)
- Practical significance? (effect size matters)
- Which variant won?

USER SEGMENTATION

**Common Segments**:
- By signup date (new users, 7d, 30d, 90d+)
- By usage level (power users, regular, dormant)
- By feature adoption (adopted feature X, not adopted)
- By geography (US, EU, APAC, etc.)
- By subscription (free, trial, paid)
- By browser/OS (web, iOS, Android)
- By acquisition source (organic, paid, referral)

**Segment Analysis**:
- How does each segment convert?
- How do segments engage differently?
- Which segments are most valuable?
- Where are churn risks?

COHORT ANALYSIS

**Retention Cohorts** (by signup date):
```
       Week 0  Week 1  Week 2  Week 3  Week 4
Jan 1  10000   6500    4200    3100    2400
Jan 8  12000   7200    5100    3900    3200
Jan 15 11500   7400    5500    4200    3500
```

- Week 0: 100% (baseline)
- Week 1: 65% retained
- Week 2: 42% retained
- Week 3: 31% retained
- Week 4: 24% retained

**Trend**: Are retention curves improving or declining?

FUNNEL ANALYSIS

**Signup Funnel**:
1. Landing page view: 50,000
2. Signup form opened: 15,000 (30%)
3. Form submitted: 8,000 (16%)
4. Email verified: 6,500 (13%)
5. First login: 5,200 (10%)

**Identify leaks**:
- Biggest drop: Landing → Form open (70% loss)
- Action: Simplify CTA, better positioning

DATA QUALITY

**Data Validation Rules**:
- Event timestamp is valid (within last 30 days)
- Event name matches schema
- User ID format correct
- Required properties present
- No PII in properties
- Session ID format correct

**Data Quality Checks**:
- Duplicate events (deduplication)
- Missing properties (tracking gaps)
- Invalid timestamps (clock skew)
- Schema violations (breaking changes)
- Anomalies (sudden spikes or drops)

**Monitoring Data Quality**:
- Alert if event drop > 20% from baseline
- Alert if > 5% events invalid
- Daily data quality report
- Schema version tracking

TOOLS & PLATFORMS

**Event Collection**:
- Segment (event hub, routing)
- mParticle (collection, routing)
- Custom SDKs (direct integration)
- Server-side tracking (backend)
- Client-side tracking (JavaScript)

**Analysis Platforms**:
- Amplitude (product analytics)
- Mixpanel (user analytics)
- Google Analytics (web analytics)
- Heap (automatic event capture)
- PostHog (open-source alternative)

**Data Warehousing**:
- BigQuery (Google)
- Snowflake (multi-cloud)
- Redshift (AWS)
- Postgres (self-hosted)

**Visualization**:
- Tableau (business intelligence)
- Looker (BI + embedded)
- Metabase (open-source)
- Grafana (monitoring + analytics)

GDPR & PRIVACY COMPLIANCE

**Tracking Consent**:
- Explicit opt-in before tracking (not opt-out)
- Clear disclosure of what's tracked
- Easy opt-out option
- Consent withdrawal honored

**Data Retention**:
- Raw events: 90 days
- Aggregated metrics: 2 years
- Audit logs: 1 year
- User deletion: 30 days

**Right to Access**:
- Users can request their event data
- User can see what events were collected
- Provide in machine-readable format (JSON/CSV)

**Right to Be Forgotten**:
- User can request data deletion
- Delete all events with their user_id
- Remove from all systems (including backups after retention)
