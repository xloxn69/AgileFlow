UX LAWS & DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS

**CRITICAL**: Users judge products by how they feel to use, not technical excellence. Apply these psychological principles and design fundamentals to every UI implementation.

### Core Psychological Laws

**Jakob's Law**: Users expect your product to work like everything else they know
- ✅ Use familiar patterns for navigation, forms, buttons, icons
- ✅ Place logo top-left (89% better recall), search top-right, cart top-right
- ✅ Touch gestures should match physical world expectations
- ❌ Never innovate at micro-interaction level (save originality for macro experience)
- Example: Don't reinvent how dropdowns work; users have strong mental models

**Miller's Law**: Average person holds 7±2 items in working memory
- ✅ Break long forms into chunks (phone: (555) 123-4567, not 5551234567)
- ✅ Group navigation into 5-7 categories maximum
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure to reveal complexity gradually
- ✅ Credit cards: 4 groups of 4 digits, not 16 consecutive
- Example: Netflix shows 6 items per carousel row

**Hick's Law**: Decision time increases with number of choices
- ✅ Minimize options when response time is critical
- ✅ Break complex tasks into smaller steps (multi-step forms)
- ✅ Use filters/search for large item sets
- ✅ Google's minimal homepage: almost no choices = instant action
- ❌ Don't overwhelm users with 20 buttons on first screen

**Gestalt Principles**: Humans organize visual information predictably
- ✅ Proximity: Group related elements close together
- ✅ Similarity: Same color/shape/size = same category
- ✅ Common Region: Elements within borders are perceived as groups
- ✅ Prägnanz: Use simplest possible visual form (less cognitive effort)
- Example: Form fields grouped by section with spacing/borders

**Fitts's Law**: Time to target = distance/size
- ✅ Make touch targets large (minimum 44×44px mobile, 40×40px desktop)
- ✅ Add ample spacing between clickable elements
- ✅ Place important actions within thumb reach on mobile
- ✅ Screen edges/corners are "infinite targets" (can't overshoot)
- ❌ Don't use tiny buttons or cramped interfaces

**Serial Position Effect**: Users remember first and last items best
- ✅ Place most important nav items at far left and far right
- ✅ Put critical CTAs at beginning or end of content
- ❌ Don't bury important actions in the middle
- Example: Apple, Nike position key nav at left/right extremes

**Von Restorff Effect**: Distinctive items stand out in memory
- ✅ Use contrasting color for primary CTA only
- ✅ Netflix: Red for all clickable elements, neutral for rest
- ❌ Don't make everything stand out (nothing will)
- Pattern: One primary button per screen, rest are secondary/tertiary

**Peak-End Rule**: Users judge experiences by peaks and endings
- ✅ Create memorable moments at emotional peaks (success states)
- ✅ Make endings delightful (Mailchimp high-five after send)
- ✅ Instagram: Heart animation instant (peak moment)
- ❌ Don't let negative experiences be the last thing users see

**Doherty Threshold**: Sub-400ms response = addictive engagement
- ✅ Provide immediate visual feedback (<400ms)
- ✅ Use optimistic UI (show result before server confirms)
- ✅ Skeleton screens while loading
- ✅ Instagram: Upload starts immediately, queues during offline
- ❌ Don't make users wait without feedback

**Tesler's Law**: Complexity can't be eliminated, only transferred
- ✅ Absorb complexity in the system, not the user
- ✅ Auto-populate fields based on context
- ✅ Smart defaults reduce user decisions
- ✅ Email clients suggest recipients from prior emails
- ❌ Don't make users manually input what system can infer

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout Principles

**Aesthetic-Usability Effect**: Beautiful designs feel more usable
- ✅ Polish visual design even for MVP
- ✅ Consistent spacing, typography, color palette
- ✅ Users tolerate minor usability issues in beautiful interfaces
- Pattern: Use 8px spacing grid for consistency

**F-Pattern & Z-Pattern Reading**: Users scan predictably
- ✅ Most important content top-left (F-pattern for text-heavy)
- ✅ Key actions top-left → top-right → bottom-right (Z-pattern for simple layouts)
- ✅ Break content into scannable chunks with subheadings
- Example: Forms follow F-pattern with labels left-aligned

**Law of Proximity**: Nearby elements are perceived as related
- ✅ Group form fields by section with whitespace
- ✅ Place labels near their inputs
- ✅ Separate unrelated sections with spacing
- Spacing: 8px within groups, 24-32px between groups

**Color Contrast**: WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI
- ✅ Use contrast checker tools
- ✅ Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- ✅ Test with colorblind simulators
- Pattern: Text #333 on #FFF = 12.6:1 (excellent)

### Interaction Design Principles

**Consistency**: Same action always produces same result
- ✅ Maintain button styles across entire product
- ✅ Use same icons for same actions everywhere
- ✅ Predictable navigation structure
- ❌ Don't change interaction patterns between screens

**Feedback**: System must respond to every user action
- ✅ Button press shows visual state change
- ✅ Form submission shows loading state
- ✅ Success/error messages after operations
- ✅ Hover states on interactive elements
- Pattern: Loading → Success/Error with clear messaging

**Affordances**: Design communicates how to use it
- ✅ Buttons look clickable (raised, shadowed, contrasting)
- ✅ Text inputs look editable (border, cursor change)
- ✅ Links look different from text (underline, color)
- ❌ Don't make clickable things look static

**Constraints**: Prevent errors before they happen
- ✅ Disable submit button until form is valid
- ✅ Input masks for phone/date/credit card
- ✅ Dropdown instead of free text when options are finite
- Pattern: Real-time validation as user types

**Recognition over Recall**: Show options, don't require memory
- ✅ Autocomplete for common inputs
- ✅ Date picker instead of typing format
- ✅ Breadcrumbs show navigation path
- ❌ Don't make users remember commands or syntax

### Speed & Performance (Perceived > Actual)

**Perceived Speed Matters More**: Users judge by feel
- ✅ Optimistic UI: Show result immediately, sync in background
- ✅ Skeleton screens create perception of speed
- ✅ Progress indicators set expectations
- ✅ Misdirection: Draw attention to other tasks while loading
- Example: Instagram heart animates instantly while request processes

**Intentional Delays**: Sometimes slower feels better
- ✅ Add 300-500ms delay for critical actions (creates trust)
- ✅ Search: Debounce 300ms to avoid flickering results
- ❌ Don't make everything instant (may feel broken)
- Pattern: File uploads with progress bar feel more secure

### Content & Microcopy Principles

**Clarity Above All**: Answer user questions
- ✅ What's that? What does it do? Where? How?
- ✅ Tell users exactly what to do (actionable language)
- ✅ Break complex concepts into steps
- Example: "Save Changes" not "Submit"

**Brand Voice + Tone**: Consistent voice, adjusted tone
- ✅ Define 3-4 adjectives for voice (friendly, professional, witty)
- ✅ Adjust tone to user emotional state
- ✅ Celebrate successes enthusiastically
- ✅ Use serious tone for consequential decisions
- ❌ Don't joke during error states

**Anticipate Questions**: Provide context proactively
- ✅ Show where to find CVC code on credit cards
- ✅ Explain why you need permissions before asking
- ✅ Tooltips for unfamiliar icons/terms
- Pattern: "?" icon with hover tooltip for complex fields

### Mobile-Specific Principles

**Thumb Zone**: 75% of users use thumbs
- ✅ Place primary actions in bottom third of screen
- ✅ Avoid top corners (hardest to reach)
- ✅ Bottom navigation bars for key actions
- Pattern: Bottom tabs for iOS/Android navigation

**Touch Targets**: Minimum 44×44px (iOS HIG), 48×48dp (Material)
- ✅ Generous spacing between buttons (8px minimum)
- ✅ Larger targets for primary actions (56×56px+)
- ❌ Don't use desktop button sizes on mobile

**One-Handed Use**: Design for single-thumb operation
- ✅ Bottom sheets instead of top modals
- ✅ Swipe gestures for common actions
- ✅ FAB (Floating Action Button) in bottom-right
- Pattern: Pull-to-refresh feels natural

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Minimum)

**Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order must be logical
- ✅ All interactive elements reachable via Tab
- ✅ Enter/Space activates buttons/links
- ✅ Escape closes modals/dropdowns
- ✅ Arrow keys navigate lists/menus
- Pattern: Focus indicators clearly visible (outline/ring)

**Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML + ARIA
- ✅ Use <button>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <header>
- ✅ Alt text for images (descriptive, not decorative)
- ✅ aria-label for icon-only buttons
- ✅ aria-live for dynamic content updates
- Test: Use NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac) to navigate

**Color Independence**: Don't rely on color alone
- ✅ Error messages include icons + text
- ✅ Links underlined + different color
- ✅ Form validation shows icon + message
- Pattern: Red X + "Error: Password must be 8+ characters"

### Error Prevention & Handling

**Confirmation for Destructive Actions**: Prevent mistakes
- ✅ "Are you sure?" modal for delete/cancel
- ✅ Undo option for reversible actions
- ✅ Clear explanation of consequences
- Example: Hubspot confirms before deletions

**Helpful Error Messages**: Tell users how to fix
- ✅ "Password must contain 8+ characters" not "Invalid password"
- ✅ Show which field has error (inline, near field)
- ✅ Suggest corrections when possible
- ❌ Don't show generic "Error 500" messages

**Forgiving Input**: Accept variations gracefully
- ✅ Trim whitespace from inputs
- ✅ Accept phone numbers with/without formatting
- ✅ Case-insensitive email validation
- Pattern: Auto-format as user types
