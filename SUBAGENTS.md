# AgileFlow Subagents Guide

This document explains how to use the 8 specialized subagents included with AgileFlow.

## What are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that operate in **separate context windows** from your main conversation with Claude. Each subagent has:
- Focused expertise and specialized knowledge
- Defined scope and boundaries
- Specific tool access
- Consistent behavior contracts

## ‚ú® NEW in v2.7.0: Proactive & Connected

All subagents now feature enhanced intelligence and coordination:

### üîÑ **Proactive FIRST ACTION**
Agents **load knowledge BEFORE asking** you:
- Read `status.json` ‚Üí Current story statuses, WIP, blockers
- Read `bus/log.jsonl` ‚Üí Recent agent coordination messages
- Read `CLAUDE.md` ‚Üí Project conventions and architecture
- Check `docs/10-research/` ‚Üí Existing research notes
- Check `docs/03-decisions/` ‚Üí Architectural constraints

Then provide **status summaries** and **auto-suggest prioritized actions** with reasoning.

### üó£Ô∏è **Shared Vocabulary**
All agents speak the same language:
- **Common Terms**: Story (US-####), Epic (EP-####), AC (Acceptance Criteria), DoR (Definition of Ready), Bus (message bus), Blocker, Unblock
- **Agent IDs**: MENTOR, AG-UI, AG-API, AG-CI, AG-DEVOPS, EPIC-PLANNER, ADR-WRITER, RESEARCH

### üîó **Cross-Agent Coordination**
Agents communicate via standardized **bus messages** in `docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl`:
```jsonl
{"ts":"2025-10-21T10:00:00Z","from":"AG-UI","type":"blocked","story":"US-0042","text":"Blocked: needs API endpoint from US-0040"}
{"ts":"2025-10-21T10:15:00Z","from":"AG-API","type":"unblock","story":"US-0040","text":"API ready, unblocking US-0042"}
```

**Message Types**: `status`, `blocked`, `unblock`, `assign`, `handoff`, `question`, `research-request`, `research-complete`

2. Epic creation: EP-0003 "User authentication system"
3. Stories needed: ~5 stories (backend, UI, tests, deployment)

‚ö†Ô∏è No existing database ADR found - this will be ADR-0003

ADR outline:
- **Title**: ADR-0003: PostgreSQL for primary database
- **Context**: Need relational integrity for user/order data, ACID guarantees
- **Decision**: Use PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension
- **Alternatives considered**:

  - MySQL: Mature but weaker JSON support
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Strong consistency, mature ecosystem, JSON + relational
  - Negative: More complex schema migrations than NoSQL
  - Neutral: Requires learning SQL for team members familiar with MongoDB

Research integration: Benchmarks from 20251015-database-comparison.md support decision

## AG-UI ‚Üî AG-API Coordination Example

One of the most common coordination patterns is between AG-UI and AG-API when UI components need backend endpoints. Here's how the v2.7.0 blocking/unblocking protocol works:

### Scenario: User Profile Display Feature

**Initial State** (from status.json):
```json
{
  "stories": [
    {
      "id": "US-0040",
      "title": "User profile API endpoint",
      "owner": "AG-API",
      "status": "ready",
      "estimate": "1d"
    },
    {
      "id": "US-0042",
      "title": "User profile display component",
      "owner": "AG-UI",
      "status": "ready",
      "estimate": "1d",
      "depends_on": ["US-0040"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 1: AG-UI Detects Blocking Dependency

When AG-UI is invoked for US-0042, it proactively checks dependencies:

```
AG-UI First Message:
‚ö†Ô∏è US-0042 depends on US-0040 (User profile API endpoint) which is still 'ready' (not done).
I cannot implement the profile display without the endpoint.

Marking US-0042 as 'blocked' and notifying AG-API via bus.
```

**AG-UI actions**:
1. Updates status.json: US-0042 status ‚Üí `blocked`
2. Appends bus message:
```jsonl
{"ts":"2025-10-21T10:00:00Z","from":"AG-UI","type":"blocked","story":"US-0042","text":"Blocked: needs GET /api/users/:id endpoint from US-0040"}
```

### Step 2: AG-API Proactively Detects Blocker

When AG-API is invoked next, it **always checks the bus for AG-UI blockers** in its FIRST ACTION:

```
AG-API First Message:
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: 1 AG-UI story blocked waiting for API endpoint:
- US-0042: User profile display (blocked on US-0040: GET /api/users/:id)

Auto-suggestions (prioritizing AG-UI unblocking):
- US-0040: User profile API endpoint (estimate: 1d, unblocks: US-0042) üî• PRIORITY
- US-0060: Admin dashboard API (estimate: 2d)

I'll automatically notify AG-UI when US-0040 endpoint is ready.
Should I start with US-0040 to unblock AG-UI? (YES/NO)
```

### Step 3: AG-API Implements and Unblocks

User chooses YES. AG-API implements US-0040 and upon completion:

**AG-API actions**:
1. Updates status.json: US-0040 status ‚Üí `done`
2. Updates status.json: US-0042 status ‚Üí `ready` (unblocking AG-UI)
3. Appends detailed unblock message:
```jsonl
{"ts":"2025-10-21T11:30:00Z","from":"AG-API","type":"unblock","story":"US-0040","text":"Endpoint GET /api/users/:id ready (returns 200 OK with {id, name, email, avatar, createdAt}), unblocking US-0042"}
```

### Step 4: AG-UI Proceeds with Implementation

When AG-UI is invoked again for US-0042, it checks the bus:

```
AG-UI First Message:
‚úÖ US-0042 unblocked! AG-API completed endpoint GET /api/users/:id
Endpoint details from bus: 200 OK, returns {id, name, email, avatar, createdAt}

Ready to implement profile display component.
Proceed with US-0042? (YES/NO)
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **AG-UI marks stories as `blocked`** when dependencies aren't met
2. **AG-API actively searches for AG-UI blockers** on every invocation
3. **AG-API prioritizes unblocking work** in its auto-suggestions
4. **Detailed unblock messages** include endpoint method, path, response format
5. **Both agents update status.json** to maintain single source of truth
6. **Bus messages create audit trail** for debugging coordination issues

---

## Workflow: Using Multiple Subagents

A typical feature implementation might use multiple subagents:

1. **Research** (if needed):
   ```
   Use the agileflow-research subagent to research OAuth 2.1 implementation patterns
   ```

2. **Plan**:
   ```
   Use the agileflow-epic-planner subagent to break down the OAuth implementation into stories
   ```

3. **Document Decision**:
   ```
   Use the agileflow-adr-writer subagent to document why we chose OAuth 2.1 over OAuth 2.0
   ```

4. **Implement UI**:
   ```
   Use the agileflow-ui subagent to implement US-0050 (OAuth login button)
   ```

5. **Implement Backend**:
   ```
   Use the agileflow-api subagent to implement US-0051 (OAuth callback handler)
   ```

6. **Set up Tests**:
   ```
   Use the agileflow-ci subagent to add OAuth integration tests to CI
   ```

## Subagents vs Commands

| When to Use | Subagent | Slash Command |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Complex implementation | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Multi-step workflow | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Need to run commands | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è (limited) |
| Quick status update | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Generate template | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Simple file operation | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

---

## Tips for Using Subagents

1. **Be specific**: Include story IDs, file paths, or clear requirements
2. **One task at a time**: Let subagent complete before moving to next
3. **Check status.json**: After subagent work, verify status was updated
4. **Use mentor for guidance**: When unsure, start with `agileflow-mentor`
5. **Chain subagents**: Plan ‚Üí Document ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test

---

## Subagent Guarantees

All AgileFlow subagents follow these contracts:

- ‚úÖ **Diff-first**: Always show changes before applying
- ‚úÖ **YES/NO confirmation**: Require explicit approval
- ‚úÖ **JSON validation**: Never break status.json or bus/log.jsonl
- ‚úÖ **Status updates**: Update docs/09-agents/status.json
- ‚úÖ **Message bus**: Log coordination to bus/log.jsonl
- ‚úÖ **Tests required**: Implementation includes tests
- ‚úÖ **Conventional commits**: Use proper commit formats
- ‚úÖ **No secrets**: Never commit credentials or tokens

---

## Installation

Subagents are included with the AgileFlow plugin. After installing the plugin:

1. Subagents are available immediately via invocation
2. No additional configuration needed
3. They automatically access your project's docs/ structure

---

## Customization

You can customize subagents by:
1. Editing files in `AgileFlow/agents/*.md`
2. Modifying the system prompt sections
3. Adjusting tool access in frontmatter
4. Changing scope boundaries

---

## Troubleshooting

**Subagent not recognizing story IDs?**
- Ensure docs/09-agents/status.json exists and is valid JSON

**Subagent skipping tests?**
- Check the subagent's quality checklist in its .md file

**JSON validation errors?**
- Subagent will auto-repair and explain the fix

**Need broader context?**
- Use `agileflow-mentor` - it reads the entire knowledge index
