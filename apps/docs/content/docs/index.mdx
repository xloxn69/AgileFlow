# Welcome to AgileFlow

AgileFlow is an AI-driven agile development system that brings powerful automation to your workflow with **41 commands**, **26 specialized agents**, and **23 reusable skills**.

<Callout>
  Transform your development workflow with AI-powered agile project management directly in your IDE.
</Callout>

## Why AgileFlow?

AgileFlow eliminates the context switching between your IDE and project management tools. Everything you need for agile development is at your fingertips:

- **Write stories** with AI-generated acceptance criteria
- **Plan sprints** with velocity tracking and capacity planning
- **Assign work** to specialized AI agents
- **Track progress** with visual kanban boards
- **Document decisions** with Architecture Decision Records
- **Deploy faster** with automated CI/CD pipelines

## Quick Start

Install AgileFlow with a single command:

```bash
npx @xloxn69/agileflow install
```

Then create your first story:

```bash
/AgileFlow:story
```

That's it! AgileFlow will guide you through creating a properly formatted user story with acceptance criteria, story points, and test scenarios.

## Key Features

    C --> D[Assign to Agent]
    D --> E[Agent Implements]
    E --> F[Auto-test & Deploy]
```

1. **Describe** what you want to build in natural language
2. **AgileFlow creates** structured stories with acceptance criteria
3. **Specialized agents** implement features following best practices
4. **Automated testing** and deployment pipelines ensure quality
5. **Documentation syncs** automatically with code changes

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical AgileFlow workflow:

```bash
# 1. Create a feature epic
/AgileFlow:epic
> "Complete user authentication system"

# 2. Plan the sprint
/AgileFlow:sprint
> Select stories from backlog
> Review team capacity (25 points)
> Set sprint goal

# 3. Implement with agents
@agileflow-api implement login endpoint for AF-001
@agileflow-ui create login form for AF-001
@agileflow-testing add auth tests for AF-001

# 4. Track progress
/AgileFlow:board
> View kanban board
> See work in progress

# 5. Create pull request
/AgileFlow:pr AF-001
> Auto-generated PR description
> Testing instructions included

# 6. Document decision
/AgileFlow:adr
> "Use JWT for authentication"

# 7. Deploy
/AgileFlow:deploy
> Automated deployment to production
```
