# Installation

AgileFlow is distributed as an npm package that installs directly into your project, adding slash commands, agents, and project structure.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0 or higher
- **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI for Claude)
- A Git repository for your project

## Quick Install

Run this single command in your project root:

```bash
npx agileflow setup
```

This will:

1. Create `.agileflow/` directory with core configuration
2. Add `.claude/commands/agileflow/` with 40+ slash commands
3. Set up `docs/` structure for project management
4. Configure hooks for automation

### Installed Commands

All commands become available as `/agileflow:command-name` in Claude Code:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agileflow:epic` | Create a new epic |
| `/agileflow:story` | Create a user story |
| `/agileflow:status` | Update story status |
| `/agileflow:board` | View kanban board |
| `/agileflow:babysit` | Start guided implementation |

See the [full command reference](/commands) for all 40+ commands.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash
# In Claude Code, run:
/agileflow:help
```

You should see the AgileFlow help menu with all available commands.

## IDE Support

AgileFlow works with multiple AI-powered IDEs:

### Claude Code (Recommended)

Native support - commands work out of the box after installation.

### Cursor

```bash
npx agileflow setup --ide cursor
```

### Windsurf

```bash
npx agileflow setup --ide windsurf
```

## Configuration

After installation, you can customize AgileFlow behavior:

```bash
/agileflow:configure
```

This interactive command lets you:

- Enable/disable features
- Set default owners for stories
- Configure hooks and automation
- Adjust status line display

See [Configuration](/configuration) for all options.

## Updating

To update AgileFlow to the latest version:

```bash
npx agileflow@latest setup
```

Your existing project data (epics, stories, status) is preserved.

## Uninstalling

To remove AgileFlow from your project:

```bash
# Remove AgileFlow directories
rm -rf .agileflow
rm -rf .claude/commands/agileflow

# Optionally remove docs (contains your project data)
rm -rf docs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Commands not appearing

Make sure you're running Claude Code from your project root where AgileFlow was installed.

### Permission errors

Ensure you have write access to the project directory:

```bash
chmod -R u+w .agileflow .claude docs
```

### Node version issues

AgileFlow requires Node.js 18+:

```bash
node --version  # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
```

## Next Steps

Now that AgileFlow is installed:

1. **Create your first epic**: `/agileflow:epic EPIC=EP-0001 TITLE="My Feature"`
2. **Break it into stories**: `/agileflow:story EPIC=EP-0001 STORY=US-0001 TITLE="First task"`
3. **Start working**: `/agileflow:babysit`

Use `/agileflow:help` to see all available commands.
