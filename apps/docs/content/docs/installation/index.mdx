# Installation

AgileFlow is distributed as an npm package that installs directly into your project, adding slash commands, agents, and project structure.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0 or higher
- **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, or **OpenAI Codex CLI**
- A Git repository for your project

## Quick Install

```bash
npx agileflow@latest setup
```

That's it! The `npx` command always fetches the latest version, so you never have to worry about outdated installations.

### Updates

```bash
npx agileflow@latest update
```

## After Setup

```bash
/agileflow:help              # View all commands
/agileflow:configure         # Configure hooks, status line, etc.
/agileflow:babysit           # Interactive mentor for implementation
```

You should see the AgileFlow help menu with all available commands.

## IDE Support

AgileFlow works with multiple AI-powered IDEs:

| IDE | Status | Config Location |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | Supported | `.claude/commands/agileflow/` |
| Cursor | Supported | `.cursor/commands/agileflow/` |
| Windsurf | Supported | `.windsurf/workflows/agileflow/` |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | Supported | `.codex/skills/` and `~/.codex/prompts/` |

### IDE-Specific Setup

```bash
# Claude Code (default)
agileflow setup

# Cursor
agileflow setup --ide cursor

# Windsurf
agileflow setup --ide windsurf

# OpenAI Codex CLI
agileflow setup --ide codex
```

## Configuration

After installation, you can customize AgileFlow behavior:

```bash
/agileflow:configure
```

This interactive command lets you:

- Enable/disable features
- Set default owners for stories
- Configure hooks and automation
- Adjust status line display

See [Configuration](/configuration) for all options.

## Updating

To update AgileFlow to the latest version:

```bash
npx agileflow@latest setup
```

Your existing project data (epics, stories, status) is preserved.

## Uninstalling

To remove AgileFlow from your project:

```bash
# Remove AgileFlow directories
rm -rf .agileflow
rm -rf .claude/commands/agileflow

# Optionally remove docs (contains your project data)
rm -rf docs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Commands not appearing

Make sure you're running Claude Code from your project root where AgileFlow was installed.

### Permission errors

Ensure you have write access to the project directory:

```bash
chmod -R u+w .agileflow .claude docs
```

### Node version issues

AgileFlow requires Node.js 18+:

```bash
node --version  # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
```

## Next Steps

Now that AgileFlow is installed:

1. **Create your first epic**: `/agileflow:epic EPIC=EP-0001 TITLE="My Feature"`
2. **Break it into stories**: `/agileflow:story EPIC=EP-0001 STORY=US-0001 TITLE="First task"`
3. **Start working**: `/agileflow:babysit`

Use `/agileflow:help` to see all available commands.
