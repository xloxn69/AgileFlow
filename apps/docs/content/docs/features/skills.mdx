# Skills System

The Skills system lets you create and manage custom AI prompts that learn and improve over time. Skills are reusable, research-backed templates that combine your project's best practices, external documentation, and codebase patterns into focused, actionable guides for Claude.

## What Are Skills?

A **skill** is a structured prompt template that teaches Claude how to handle specific tasks in your project context. Skills are:

- **Research-backed** - Generated from web docs, local documentation, and your codebase
- **Self-improving** - Learn from your corrections and refine automatically
- **Cookbook-based** - Multiple use-case workflows in a single skill
- **Integrable** - Can include Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for tool access

### Example Skills

You might create skills for:

- **Database operations**: "Supabase Swift" - How to work with Supabase in your iOS app
- **API patterns**: "REST API clients" - Best practices for your project's API integration pattern
- **Component development**: "React components with accessibility" - How to build components following your standards
- **Deployment**: "GitHub Actions CI/CD" - Your team's deployment and testing workflow
- **Domain expertise**: "Machine Learning with TensorFlow" - Best practices specific to your ML projects

## Core Concepts

### Skill Structure

Each skill contains:

```
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file with activation triggers and instructions
├── references.md         # Links to web docs, local docs, and code patterns
├── cookbook/             # Per-use-case workflows
│   ├── use-case-1.md
│   └── use-case-2.md
└── .mcp.json            # Optional MCP server configuration
```

### How Skills Work

1. **Activation**: When you ask Claude about a topic matching a skill's triggers, the skill activates
2. **Execution**: Claude reads SKILL.md and follows the instructions
3. **Learning**: When you correct Claude, the skill learns your preferences
4. **Evolution**: Each correction updates the learnings file, making the skill smarter

### Learnings System

Skills can improve automatically through a learnings system:

```
.agileflow/skills/_learnings/
├── supabase-swift.yaml
├── api-client.yaml
└── react-components.yaml
```

Each learnings file tracks:
- **Preferences** - What users prefer (formatting, style, approach)
- **Conventions** - Project-specific patterns and standards
- **Anti-patterns** - What to avoid
- **Examples** - Good and bad examples from corrections

## Creating Skills

### Quick Start

Create a skill with intelligent research:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:create
```

Or provide a hint:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:create supabase-swift
```

### How Creation Works

The `/agileflow:skill:create` command performs comprehensive research:

**Phase 1: Requirements**
- You describe what you need (technology, use cases, framework)

**Phase 2: Research**
- **Web documentation** - Official docs, API references, tutorials
- **Local documentation** - Your project's docs, architecture decisions, practices
- **Codebase patterns** - Existing code examples and conventions
- **MCP servers** - Available tools for the technology

**Phase 3: Generation**
The command generates:
- **SKILL.md** - Main skill with activation triggers and cookbook
- **references.md** - Documentation links and code patterns
- **cookbook/** - Workflows for different use cases
- **.mcp.json** - Server config (if applicable)

**Phase 4: Confirmation**
You see the generated structure and can create, edit, or cancel.

## Managing Skills

### List All Skills

View your installed skills:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:list
```

Shows:
- Skill names and descriptions
- Supported use cases
- MCP integration status
- File count

### Edit Skills

Modify an existing skill:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:edit <skill-name>
```

You can:
- Update SKILL.md instructions
- Add new cookbook entries
- Update references and documentation links
- Rename the skill
- Do a full rewrite with fresh research

### Test Skills

Verify a skill works correctly:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:test <skill-name>
```

Tests:
- **Structure validation** - All required files present
- **Content validation** - Proper formatting and size
- **Activation test** - Skill activates on sample prompts
- **MCP configuration** - Valid server setup

### Delete Skills

Remove a skill when no longer needed:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:delete <skill-name>
```

### Upgrade Skills

Add learning capability to older skills:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:upgrade <skill-name>
```

Or upgrade all at once:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:upgrade --all
```

Creates a learnings file that tracks corrections and improvements.

## The Learnings System

### What Skills Learn

When you use a skill and correct Claude's output, the skill learns:

1. **Explicit corrections** - High confidence learnings from direct feedback
2. **Approved responses** - Medium confidence learnings from approvals
3. **Patterns** - Low confidence observations for review

### Learning File Format

Each skill has an optional learnings file at `.agileflow/skills/_learnings/<skill>.yaml`:

```yaml
skill: supabase-swift
version: 1
last_updated: 2025-01-08T10:30:00Z

preferences:
  code_style: "swift-concurrency"
  error_handling: "Result<T, Error>"
  async_patterns: "async/await"

conventions:
  naming: "camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types"
  structure: "Separate data, service, and UI layers"
  testing: "Unit tests required for all public APIs"

anti_patterns:
  - "Avoid callback patterns (use async/await instead)"
  - "Never hardcode API keys in code"

examples:
  good:
    - "let user = try await supabase.auth.user()"
  bad:
    - "var apiKey = 'sk-...' // Never do this"

metadata:
  corrections_count: 12
  approvals_count: 8
  last_correction: 2025-01-08T10:30:00Z
```

### How Self-Improvement Works

**On invocation:**
1. Claude checks if a learnings file exists
2. Reads preferences, conventions, and anti-patterns
3. Applies them while executing the skill

**On correction:**
1. You provide feedback or correction
2. Claude extracts the signal (what to change)
3. Determines confidence level (high/medium/low)
4. Updates the learnings file
5. Next invocation uses the updated preferences

## Best Practices

### Creating Effective Skills

1. **Use specific names** - `supabase-swift` not just `database`
2. **Include multiple use cases** - Add cookbook entries for different scenarios
3. **Link to project patterns** - Reference your codebase conventions
4. **Add troubleshooting** - Anticipate and address common issues
5. **Keep it focused** - One domain per skill, not too broad

### Maintaining Skills

1. **Test regularly** - Use `/agileflow:skill:test` to verify quality
2. **Review learnings** - Check what the skill learned from corrections
3. **Update references** - Keep documentation links current
4. **Archive unused skills** - Clean up skills you no longer use
5. **Share improvements** - Commit learnings to git for team consistency

### Organizing Skills

**Suggested skill categories:**

- **Data layer** - Database operations, migrations, queries
- **API layer** - REST clients, GraphQL, webhooks, authentication
- **UI layer** - Components, styling, accessibility, animations
- **Infrastructure** - Deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, security
- **Workflows** - Testing, code review, debugging, profiling
- **Domain** - ML models, image processing, payment processing

## Cookbook Workflows

### What Is a Cookbook?

A cookbook entry is a step-by-step guide for a specific use case within a skill.

### Cookbook Template

```markdown
# Use Case Title

Brief description of this workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Prerequisite 1
- Prerequisite 2

## Instructions

1. **Step 1**: Description with example
   ```language
   code example
   ```

2. **Step 2**: Next step
   ```language
   code example
   ```

## Example

**Input**: Sample input or scenario
**Output**: Expected output

## Troubleshooting

- **Problem**: Solution
```

### When to Add Cookbooks

Add cookbook entries when:
- Multiple common use cases exist
- Different workflows apply
- Setup differs between scenarios
- Users frequently ask for step-by-step guidance

## MCP Integration

Skills can integrate with Model Context Protocol servers for tool access.

### What Is MCP?

MCP servers extend Claude's capabilities by providing:
- Real-time data access
- Tool execution (file operations, network calls)
- System integration (APIs, databases)
- Specialized knowledge (documentation, code tools)

### Using MCP in Skills

If an MCP server is found during creation, the skill includes `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@supabase/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "${SUPABASE_URL}",
        "SUPABASE_KEY": "${SUPABASE_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The skill then documents:
- Tools provided by the server
- Setup instructions
- Environment variables needed
- Integration examples

## Skill Lifecycle

### Creation

1. Run `/agileflow:skill:create`
2. Describe what you need
3. Command researches best practices
4. Review generated skill
5. Create the skill

### Usage

1. Work on tasks matching the skill's domain
2. Claude activates the skill automatically
3. Skill provides guidance and examples
4. You execute the skill's recommendations

### Improvement

1. When Claude's output misses something, correct it
2. Skill learns from the correction
3. Next time, skill provides better guidance
4. Use `/agileflow:skill:upgrade` to enable learning

### Evolution

1. Over time, skills become more tailored
2. Learnings file captures project-specific patterns
3. New team members inherit the knowledge
4. Skills become institutional memory

## Sharing Skills

### Export a Skill

Copy a skill directory to share:

```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/my-skill /path/to/share/
```

### Import a Skill

Copy to your skills directory:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/skill .claude/skills/
```

### Version Control

Commit skills to git (include learnings):

```bash
git add .claude/skills/
git add .agileflow/skills/_learnings/
git commit -m "Add supabase-swift skill with learnings"
```

Team members automatically get the skill and learnings.

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

**Problem**: You ask about the skill's topic but Claude doesn't activate it.

**Solution**:
1. Check the "When to Use" section in SKILL.md
2. Make sure your question matches the activation triggers
3. Use `/agileflow:skill:test` to verify the skill structure
4. Edit the skill to add more keywords if needed

### MCP Server Not Found

**Problem**: During creation, "MCP server not found" appears.

**Solution**:
1. You can create the skill without MCP and add it later
2. Manually set up `.mcp.json` after creation
3. Check if the server is published (npm, GitHub, etc.)

### Learnings File Missing

**Problem**: Skill doesn't improve even after corrections.

**Solution**:
1. Run `/agileflow:skill:upgrade <skill-name>`
2. This creates the learnings file
3. Future corrections will be tracked

### Skill Validation Fails

**Problem**: `/agileflow:skill:test` shows failures.

**Solution**:
1. Read the validation report for specific issues
2. Use `/agileflow:skill:edit` to fix problems
3. Test again to verify fixes

## Advanced Usage

### Creating Domain-Specific Skills

Create multiple specialized skills for complex domains:

```bash
# Data layer skills
/agileflow:skill:create postgresql-queries
/agileflow:skill:create database-migrations

# API layer skills
/agileflow:skill:create rest-error-handling
/agileflow:skill:create graphql-schema-design

# UI layer skills
/agileflow:skill:create accessibility-wcag
/agileflow:skill:create react-performance
```

### Skill Composition

Reference other skills within a skill:

In SKILL.md:
```markdown
## Related Skills

This skill works best with:
- [REST API clients](/skills/api-client)
- [Error handling patterns](/skills/error-handling)
```

### Customizing Learnings

Manually edit the learnings file for advanced customization:

```bash
.agileflow/skills/_learnings/my-skill.yaml
```

Add project-specific conventions that don't require corrections.
