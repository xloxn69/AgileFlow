description: Upgrade existing skills with self-improving learning capability
---

# /skill:upgrade

Add self-improving capability to skills so they learn from your corrections and continuously improve.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode
/agileflow:skill:upgrade

# Upgrade specific skill
/agileflow:skill:upgrade supabase-swift

# Upgrade all skills at once
/agileflow:skill:upgrade --all
```

## What It Does

Skills created before the learning system was introduced can be upgraded to gain:

1. **Learnings file** - Tracks preferences, conventions, patterns
2. **Self-improvement** - Learns from your corrections
3. **Preference persistence** - Remembers what you prefer
4. **Context accumulation** - Builds project-specific knowledge
5. **Team consistency** - Shared learnings across team

## How It Works

The upgrade process:

1. **Creates learnings file** - `.agileflow/skills/_learnings/<skill>.yaml`
2. **Updates SKILL.md** - Adds learning instructions
3. **Preserves content** - Existing skill content unchanged
4. **Enables learning** - Skill can now learn from corrections

## Learning System

### What Skills Learn

Skills track three types of learnings:

**Preferences** - How you like things done:
```yaml
preferences:
  code_style: "async/await over callbacks"
  error_handling: "Result<T, Error> type"
  naming: "camelCase for functions"
```

**Conventions** - Project patterns to follow:
```yaml
conventions:
  - "Always validate input at service layer"
  - "Use interfaces for dependency injection"
  - "Database queries in separate service files"
```

**Anti-patterns** - Things to avoid:
```yaml
anti_patterns:
  - "Avoid callback patterns (use async/await)"
  - "Never hardcode configuration"
  - "Don't put business logic in controllers"
```

### Learnings File Structure

Each upgraded skill gets a learnings file:

```
.agileflow/skills/_learnings/
├── supabase-swift.yaml
├── react-components.yaml
└── api-client.yaml
```

File format:

```yaml
skill: supabase-swift
version: 1
last_updated: 2025-01-09T10:30:00Z

preferences:
  async_pattern: "async/await"
  error_handling: "Result<T, Error>"

conventions:
  - "Separate data, service, and UI layers"
  - "Always handle network errors explicitly"

anti_patterns:
  - "Avoid callback patterns"
  - "Never hardcode API keys"

context:
  # Project-specific learnings

examples:
  good:
    - "let user = try await supabase.auth.user()"
  bad:
    - "var apiKey = 'sk-...'"

metadata:
  corrections_count: 3
  approvals_count: 5
  last_correction: 2025-01-08T10:30:00Z
  created: 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

## Workflow

```

### Step 5: Create Learnings File

The system creates `.agileflow/skills/_learnings/<skill>.yaml`:

```yaml
skill: supabase-swift
version: 1
last_updated: 2025-01-09T10:30:00Z

# =============================================================================
# PREFERENCES
# =============================================================================

  # Preferences will be learned from corrections

# =============================================================================
# CONVENTIONS
# =============================================================================
conventions:
  # - "Convention will be added from corrections"

# =============================================================================
# ANTI-PATTERNS
# =============================================================================
anti_patterns:
  # - "Things to avoid will be added here"

# =============================================================================
# CONTEXT
# =============================================================================
context:
  # Project-specific context will be learned

# =============================================================================
# EXAMPLES
# =============================================================================
examples:
  good: []
  bad: []

# =============================================================================
# METADATA
# =============================================================================
metadata:
  corrections_count: 0
  approvals_count: 0
  created: 2025-01-09T10:30:00Z
  sessions: []
```

### Step 6: Update SKILL.md

The system adds to SKILL.md:

**New section:**
```markdown
## Self-Improving Learnings

This skill learns from your corrections and preferences.

**On invocation**:
1. Check if `.agileflow/skills/_learnings/supabase-swift.yaml` exists
2. If exists, read and apply learned preferences
3. Follow conventions and avoid anti-patterns from learnings

**On correction**:
1. When user corrects output, extract the signal
2. Determine confidence level:
   - **high**: Explicit correction ("never do X", "always do Y")
   - **medium**: User approved or pattern worked well
   - **low**: Observation to review later
3. Update the learnings file with new preference

**Learnings file location**: `.agileflow/skills/_learnings/supabase-swift.yaml`
```

### Step 7: Confirm Success

```
✅ Skill upgraded successfully!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Modified: .claude/skills/supabase-swift/SKILL.md
Created:  .agileflow/skills/_learnings/supabase-swift.yaml

The skill will now:
  • Load learned preferences on each invocation
  • Extract signals from your corrections
  • Build up conventions over time
  • Avoid learned anti-patterns

Start using the skill - it will learn from your feedback!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

```

## How Skills Learn

### Phase 1: On Skill Invocation

When you use a skill that's upgraded:

1. Claude checks if learnings file exists
2. Reads preferences, conventions, anti-patterns
3. Applies them while executing the skill
4. Next time will remember your preferences

### Phase 2: On Correction

When you correct Claude's output:

1. **You provide feedback**: "No, use async/await instead"
2. **Claude extracts signal**: "Prefer async/await over callbacks"
3. **Determines confidence**:
   - **High**: Explicit correction (add to learnings)
   - **Medium**: You approved output (add to learnings)
   - **Low**: Observation (note for review)
4. **Updates learnings file**: New preference saved
5. **Next use applies it**: Skill remembers your preference

### Example Learning Cycle

**Session 1:**
```
You: "Create an API error handler"

Claude: [uses try-catch blocks]

You: "No, prefer using Result<T, Error> type"

Claude: Extracts signal and updates learnings file
  preferences.error_handling = "Result<T, Error>"
```

**Session 2:**
```
You: "Create another API error handler"

Claude: [reads learnings file]
Claude: [uses Result<T, Error> type]

You: "Perfect!"

Claude: Updates learnings metadata: approvals_count++
```

**Session 3:**
```
You: "New API handler needed"

Claude: [automatically uses Result<T, Error>]
Claude: [follows all learned conventions]

The skill improved through learning!
```

## Using Learnings

### Manual Review

Check what the skill has learned:

```bash
cat .agileflow/skills/_learnings/supabase-swift.yaml
```

### Manual Updates

Add your own preferences before corrections:

```bash
# Edit the learnings file directly
vim .agileflow/skills/_learnings/api-client.yaml

# Add your preferences
preferences:
  error_handling: "Custom error types"
  logging: "Structured JSON logging"
```

### Team Sharing

Commit learnings to git so team gets them:

```bash
git add .agileflow/skills/_learnings/
git commit -m "Add api-client learning from team feedback"
```

Team members:
```bash
git pull
# Now has the same learnings
```

## Best Practices

### When to Upgrade

Upgrade a skill when:

1. **Skill is frequently used** - More corrections = better learning
2. **Team has patterns** - Learnings capture team preferences
3. **Creating new skills** - Enable learning from start
4. **Consolidating skills** - Merge learnings from old skills

### Using Learnings Effectively

1. **Correct mistakes** - Every correction improves the skill
2. **Approve good output** - Approvals are also learnings
3. **Document patterns** - Add conventions manually
4. **Review periodically** - Check what was learned
5. **Commit to git** - Share learnings with team

### Maintaining Learnings

1. **Keep files updated** - Learnings stay current
2. **Monitor corrections** - Correct count shows usage
3. **Archive old learnings** - If consolidating skills
4. **Share improvements** - Team consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Already Upgraded?

If skill already has learning:

```
✅ Skill already upgraded!

To:
  - View learnings: cat .agileflow/skills/_learnings/<name>.yaml
  - Edit learnings: /agileflow:skill:edit <name>
  - Clear learnings: rm .agileflow/skills/_learnings/<name>.yaml
```

### No Learnings File Created

If upgrade succeeded but no learnings file:

1. Check file system:
   ```bash
   ls .agileflow/skills/_learnings/
   ```

2. Verify directory exists:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .agileflow/skills/_learnings/
   ```

3. Re-run upgrade:
   ```bash
   /agileflow:skill:upgrade <skill-name>
   ```

### Upgrade Failed

If you see an error:

```
❌ Failed to upgrade skill: Permission denied
```

**Fix**: Check permissions:
```bash
chmod -R u+w .agileflow/skills/
chmod -R u+w .agileflow/skills/_learnings/
```

Then retry upgrade.

## After Upgrade

Once upgraded:

1. **Use the skill** - Start working with it
2. **Correct Claude** - Each correction teaches the skill
3. **Monitor learning** - Check learnings file accumulation
4. **Share with team** - Commit learnings to git
