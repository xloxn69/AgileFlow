# Features

AgileFlow includes powerful features to protect your codebase, automate workflows, and keep your team productive.

## Core Features

### Skills System

Create, manage, and continuously improve custom AI prompts that learn from your feedback.

- **Research-backed creation** - Generated from web docs, local documentation, and your codebase
- **Cookbook workflows** - Multiple use-case specific guides in a single skill
- **Self-improving** - Skills learn from your corrections and refine automatically
- **MCP integration** - Connect to Model Context Protocol servers for tool access
- **Team shareable** - Commit to git and share institutional knowledge

### Agent Expertise System

Enable self-improving agents that maintain domain knowledge and accelerate task execution.

- **Expertise files** - Agents maintain mental models of their domain
- **Three-step workflow** - Plan (with expertise) → Build → Self-Improve
- **Automatic learning** - Expertise updates as agents work and make changes
- **Validation & metrics** - Tools to ensure expertise stays accurate and current
- **Focused domains** - Specialized knowledge for database, API, UI, testing, CI/CD, and more

### Parallel Sessions

Work on multiple features, bugs, or experiments simultaneously with isolated workspaces and boundary protection.

- **Git worktrees** - Each session gets its own directory and branch
- **Boundary protection** - Edit/Write hooks prevent accidental cross-session edits
- **Easy switching** - Use `/add-dir` to switch sessions in the same terminal
- **Session tracking** - AgileFlow tracks all sessions with status and activity
- **Independent context** - Each session maintains its own story and progress

## Automation

### Loop Mode

Run Claude autonomously with continuous task execution until completion.

- **Autonomous execution** - Claude works through tasks without interruption
- **Configurable limits** - Set iteration limits and timeouts
- **Progress tracking** - See what's happening at each step
- **Safe fallbacks** - Built-in safety checks prevent runaway loops

### Visual Mode

Let Claude see and interact with visual interfaces through screenshots and browser automation.

- **Screenshot analysis** - Claude can analyze visual content
- **Browser automation** - Playwright integration for web testing
- **UI verification** - Validate visual changes automatically
- **Cross-platform** - Works on any OS with browser support

### Compact Context Preservation

Preserve critical agent knowledge and state during automatic context compaction.

- **Context-aware compaction** - Critical rules preserved when Claude Code compresses context
- **Priority-based preservation** - Critical agents always preserved
- **State continuity** - Current story, blockers, and progress maintained
- **Long conversation support** - Sustained agent focus over days of work
- **Zero-overhead** - Automatic, no manual configuration needed

## Setup & Safety

### Configuration System

9 specialized agents for setting up and customizing your development workflow.

- **Git setup** - Initialize repository and remote connections
- **Hooks system** - Event-driven automation (SessionStart, PreCompact, Stop)
- **Status line** - Custom status bar in Claude Code
- **Archival** - Auto-manage status.json file size
- **CI/CD** - Automated testing with GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI
- **Attribution** - Control AI disclosure in git commits
- **And more** - PreCompact context, verification, token management

[Learn about Configuration](/docs/features/configuration)

### IDE Integrations

Install and configure AgileFlow for your favorite IDE with automatic command, agent, and skill installation.

- **Multiple IDEs** - Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenAI Codex CLI
- **Auto-detection** - Detect which IDEs are configured in your project
- **Damage Control** - Optional safety system for Claude Code
- **Dynamic content** - Commands and agents automatically injected on install
- **Multi-IDE support** - Use the same project across multiple IDEs

[Learn about IDE Integrations](/docs/features/ide-integrations)

### Damage Control

Protect your codebase from destructive commands using PreToolUse hooks.

- **Bash command validation** - Block dangerous patterns like `rm -rf /`, `git push --force`
- **File access control** - Protect secrets, keys, and critical files
- **Customizable rules** - Add project-specific protection patterns
- **Ask-first mode** - Require confirmation for risky operations
- **Three protection layers** - Bash, Edit, and Write tool validation
