# Features

AgileFlow includes powerful features to protect your codebase, automate workflows, and keep your team productive.

## Protection & Safety

### Damage Control

Prevent destructive or dangerous commands from running automatically. Uses Claude Code's PreToolUse hooks to validate commands before execution.

- **Bash command validation** - Block dangerous patterns like `rm -rf /`, `git push --force`
- **File access control** - Protect secrets, keys, and critical files
- **Customizable rules** - Add project-specific protection patterns
- **Ask-first mode** - Require confirmation for risky (but valid) operations

## Workflow Automation

### Compact Context Preservation

Preserve critical agent knowledge and state during automatic context compaction.

- **Context-aware compaction** - Critical agent rules and state preserved when Claude Code compresses context
- **Priority-based preservation** - Critical agents always preserved, others degrade gracefully
- **State continuity** - Current story, blockers, and progress maintained through compaction
- **Long conversation support** - Sustained agent focus over days of development work
- **Zero-overhead** - Automatic, no manual configuration needed

### Status Line

Display your current work in progress, project status, and cost tracking in Claude Code's status bar.

- **Real-time updates** - Shows current story, WIP count, completion percentage
- **Customizable components** - Show/hide metrics you care about
- **Git integration** - Display branch status and changes
- **Cost tracking** - Monitor API costs if enabled

Configure with `/agileflow:configure --enable=statusline`

### Archival System

Automatically manage your project status by archiving completed stories.

- **Auto-archival** - Stories completed 7+ days ago are automatically archived
- **Organized history** - Archives organized by month
- **Performance** - Keeps `status.json` small and fast
- **Preserves data** - All archives remain accessible

Configure with `/agileflow:configure --enable=archival`

### Session Management

Create isolated work sessions with automatic context management.

- **Session isolation** - Work on multiple epics in parallel
- **Git worktrees** - Automatic branch management
- **State tracking** - Remember what you were doing
- **Session history** - Review past sessions

Start with `/agileflow:session:new EPIC=EP-0001`

## Development Hooks

### SessionStart Hook

Runs when Claude Code starts, giving you project status and environment info.

- **Welcome message** - See project name and description
- **Environment check** - Verify Node.js, git, required tools
- **Status summary** - View project health and active work
- **Customizable** - Add your own startup routines

Enable with `/agileflow:configure --enable=sessionstart`

### PreCompact Hook

Runs before context compression, preserving important state.

- **State preservation** - Keeps story status during compression
- **Selective compression** - Remove only verbose data
- **Automatic** - Runs without manual intervention

Enable with `/agileflow:configure --enable=precompact`

### Stop Hooks

Run when Claude Code pauses or completes.

**RalphLoop** - Auto-improve conversation patterns
**SelfImprove** - Update agent expertise after work

Enable with `/agileflow:configure --enable=ralphloop,selfimprove`

## Data Management

### Context Export

Export full project context for sharing, backup, or external processing.

- **Complete export** - All stories, epics, decisions, research
- **Multiple formats** - JSON, Markdown, or structured output
- **Selective** - Choose what to include
- **Portable** - Use in other systems

Use with `/agileflow:context:export`

### Research System

Maintain a research knowledge base alongside development.

- **Organized notes** - Research organized by date
- **Searchable** - Find previous research quickly
- **Indexed** - Links to related stories and epics
- **Exportable** - Share research with team

Use with `/agileflow:research:ask` and `/agileflow:research:import`

## Skills & Knowledge

### Custom Skills System

Create, manage, and continuously improve custom AI prompts that learn from your feedback.

- **Research-backed creation** - Generated from web docs, local documentation, and your codebase
- **Cookbook workflows** - Multiple use-case specific guides in a single skill
- **Self-improving** - Skills learn from your corrections and refine automatically
- **MCP integration** - Connect to Model Context Protocol servers for tool access
- **Team shareable** - Commit to git and share institutional knowledge

[Learn about Skills System](/features/skills)

Use with `/agileflow:skill:create`, `/agileflow:skill:list`, `/agileflow:skill:edit`, `/agileflow:skill:test`, and `/agileflow:skill:upgrade`

## Project Intelligence

### Metrics & Analytics

Track your project's health and velocity.

- **Story metrics** - Count, completion rate, time to completion
- **Velocity tracking** - Stories per sprint
- **Quality metrics** - Test coverage, bug counts
- **Trend analysis** - See improvement over time

View with `/agileflow:metrics`

### Impact Analysis

Understand how changes affect your system.

- **Dependency mapping** - See what depends on what
- **Risk assessment** - Identify high-impact changes
- **Scope estimation** - Better understand feature size
- **Breaking change detection** - Warn about incompatibilities

Analyze with `/agileflow:impact`

## Configuration

All features are configured through the `/agileflow:configure` command:

```bash
/agileflow:configure              # Interactive configuration wizard
/agileflow:configure --detect     # See current settings
/agileflow:configure --upgrade    # Update to latest versions
```

### Feature Management

Enable individual features:

```bash
# Enable specific features
--enable=damagecontrol,statusline,archival

# Disable features
--disable=statusline

# Apply preset profiles
--profile=full     # All features
--profile=basic    # Essential only
--profile=minimal  # SessionStart + archival
--profile=none     # Disable all
```

### Customization

Customize feature behavior:

```bash
# Archival settings
--archival-days=30

# Status line components
--show=story,wip,context
--hide=model,cost,git
```
