# Installation

This guide will walk you through installing AgileFlow in your development environment.

## Quick Installation

The fastest way to get started with AgileFlow is using the install command:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npx @xloxn69/agileflow install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn dlx @xloxn69/agileflow install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx @xloxn69/agileflow install
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
  This command will set up AgileFlow in your current directory and create all necessary configuration files.
</Callout>

## What Gets Installed

The installation process will create the following structure in your project:

```
.agileflow/
├── config.json          # Main configuration
├── epics/              # Epic definitions
├── stories/            # User stories
└── .meta/              # Metadata and state

.claude/
├── commands/           # Custom slash commands
└── agents/             # Agent configurations
```

   mkdir -p .claude/{commands,agents}
   ```

2. **Create config file**:
   Create `.agileflow/config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "projectName": "My Project",
     "sprintDuration": 14,
     "velocityTracking": true
