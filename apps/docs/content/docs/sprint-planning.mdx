# Sprint Planning

Master sprint planning with AgileFlow's velocity tracking and capacity planning features.

## What is a Sprint?

A **sprint** is a time-boxed period (typically 1-2 weeks) where your team commits to completing a set of user stories.

### Sprint Goals

Every sprint should have:
- **Clear objectives**: What you'll deliver
- **Committed stories**: Work the team will complete
- **Capacity plan**: Realistic workload based on velocity
- **Definition of done**: Quality criteria

## Planning a Sprint

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Start Sprint Planning

    Run the sprint planning command:
    ```
    /AgileFlow:sprint
    ```

    AgileFlow will guide you through the process.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Review Velocity

    AgileFlow shows your team's historical velocity:
    ```
    Previous Sprints:
    - Sprint 1: 23 points
    - Sprint 2: 27 points
    - Sprint 3: 25 points

    Average Velocity: 25 points
    Recommended Capacity: 23-27 points
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Select Stories

    Choose stories from the backlog. AgileFlow helps you:
    - See story dependencies
    - Track total story points
    - Warn when approaching capacity
    - Suggest optimal story order
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set Sprint Goal

    Define what this sprint will achieve:
    ```
    Sprint Goal: Complete user authentication system
    - User login (AF-001)
    - Password reset (AF-002)
    - Email verification (AF-003)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sprint Capacity

### Calculating Capacity

Capacity is the amount of work your team can complete in a sprint.

Factors affecting capacity:
- **Team size**: Number of developers
- **Sprint duration**: Days available
- **Availability**: Holidays, vacation, meetings
- **Historical velocity**: Past performance

Example calculation:
```
Team: 3 developers
Sprint: 10 working days
Availability: 80% (account for meetings, etc.)
Historical velocity: 25 points/sprint

Recommended capacity: 23-27 points
```

<Callout>
  AgileFlow calculates capacity automatically based on your team's velocity.
</Callout>

### Capacity Warnings

AgileFlow warns you if:
- **Over-committed**: More than 110% of average velocity
- **Under-committed**: Less than 70% of average velocity
- **Unbalanced**: Some team members overloaded
- **Dependencies blocked**: Stories depend on incomplete work

## Velocity Tracking

### What is Velocity?

**Velocity** is the average number of story points your team completes per sprint.

### Tracking Velocity

AgileFlow tracks velocity automatically:

```markdown
Sprint 1: 23 points completed
Sprint 2: 27 points completed
Sprint 3: 25 points completed
Sprint 4: 26 points completed

Rolling average (last 3 sprints): 26 points
Overall average: 25.25 points
```

### Using Velocity

Use velocity to:

1. **Plan sprints**: Don't commit to more than your average velocity
2. **Forecast deliveries**: Estimate when epics will complete
3. **Identify trends**: Improving or declining performance
4. **Set expectations**: Communicate realistic timelines

<Callout type="info">
  Velocity should be used for planning, not measuring individual performance.
</Callout>

## Sprint Structure

### Daily Workflow

During the sprint:

1. **Daily standup** (optional): Brief sync on progress
2. **Work on stories**: Move stories through workflow
3. **Update status**: Keep board current
4. **Address blockers**: Resolve issues quickly

### Story Status Updates

```bash
# Start working on a story
/AgileFlow:status AF-001 in-progress

# Move to code review
/AgileFlow:status AF-001 review

# Mark as done
/AgileFlow:status AF-001 done
```

### Mid-Sprint Adjustments

If needed, adjust the sprint:

- **Add stories**: If completing ahead of schedule
- **Remove stories**: If blocked or over-committed
- **Re-prioritize**: Based on new information

<Callout type="warn">
  Frequent mid-sprint changes indicate planning issues. Review your estimation process.
</Callout>

## Sprint Board

AgileFlow provides a visual sprint board:

```
/AgileFlow:board
```

Shows:
```
┌─────────────┬──────────────┬─────────┬──────┐
│   Backlog   │ In Progress  │ Review  │ Done │
├─────────────┼──────────────┼─────────┼──────┤

Remaining: 21 points
```

## Sprint Metrics

### Key Metrics

AgileFlow tracks:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Velocity** | Points completed per sprint |
| **Commitment Reliability** | % of committed stories completed |
| **Cycle Time** | Days from start to done |
| **Lead Time** | Days from created to done |
| **Throughput** | Stories completed per sprint |

### Viewing Metrics

```bash
/AgileFlow:metrics
```

Shows:
```markdown
## Sprint 4 Metrics

**Velocity**: 26 points
**Commitment**: 21/25 points committed (84%)
**Cycle Time**: 3.2 days average
**Throughput**: 7 stories completed
**Blockers**: 1 active blocker

## Trends
- Velocity: ↑ (up from 25)
- Cycle Time: → (stable)
- Commitment Reliability: ↓ (down from 92%)
```

## Sprint Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning

**When**: Start of sprint
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Participants**: Whole team

**Agenda**:
1. Review sprint goal
2. Discuss top backlog items
3. Estimate and commit to stories
4. Verify capacity

### Daily Standup (Optional)

**When**: Daily
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Participants**: Development team

**Format**:
- What I completed yesterday
- What I'm working on today
- Any blockers

<Callout>
  AgileFlow works well with or without daily standups. Update story status regularly instead.
</Callout>

### Sprint Review

**When**: End of sprint
**Duration**: 1 hour
**Participants**: Team + stakeholders

**Agenda**:
1. Demo completed work
2. Review sprint goal achievement
3. Gather feedback
4. Update backlog based on learnings

### Sprint Retrospective

**When**: End of sprint
**Duration**: 1 hour
**Participants**: Development team

**Agenda**:
1. What went well
2. What could improve
3. Action items for next sprint

Use the retro command:
```
/AgileFlow:retro
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Set Realistic Goals

<Callout type="info">
  Commit to slightly less than your average velocity to account for unknowns.
</Callout>

Don't:
- Overcommit to please stakeholders
- Ignore historical velocity
- Add stories mid-sprint frequently

Do:
- Use velocity as a guide
- Leave buffer for unexpected work
- Protect team capacity

### 2. Focus on Completion

Prioritize completing stories over starting new ones:
- Better to finish 80% of committed work than start 100%
- Partial stories provide no value
- Reduce work-in-progress

### 3. Track Blockers

Address blockers immediately:
```bash
/AgileFlow:blockers
```

Shows:
```markdown
## Active Blockers

**AF-002**: Waiting on API access
- **Blocked since**: 2 days
- **Owner**: DevOps team
- **Action**: Follow up with platform team
```

### 4. Review and Adapt

After each sprint:
- Review what worked
- Adjust estimation if needed
- Improve processes
- Celebrate wins

### 5. Maintain Backlog Health

Keep backlog refined:
- Top stories have clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies are identified
- Estimates are recent
- Priorities are current

## Advanced Sprint Planning

### Capacity by Team Member

Plan capacity per person:

```markdown
## Sprint 4 Capacity

**Alice** (Senior): 10 points
- AF-001: User Login (5)
- AF-004: OAuth (5)

**Bob** (Mid): 8 points
- AF-002: Password Reset (5)
- AF-005: UI Polish (3)

**Carol** (Junior): 7 points
- AF-003: Email Templates (3)
- AF-006: Documentation (2)
- AF-007: Testing (2)

Total: 25 points
```

### Risk Management

Identify risky stories:
- New technology
- External dependencies
- Unclear requirements
- Complex integration

Mark risky stories:
```markdown
**AF-010**: Payment Integration
**Risk**: High
**Mitigation**: Spike story in previous sprint
```

### Sprint Goals

Write SMART sprint goals:
- **Specific**: Clear deliverables
- **Measurable**: Concrete success criteria
- **Achievable**: Within team capacity
- **Relevant**: Aligned with product roadmap
- **Time-bound**: Fits in sprint duration

Example:
```markdown
Sprint Goal: Launch beta user authentication

Success Criteria:
- Users can register and login
- Password reset works end-to-end
- All auth flows tested
- Security review complete
```

## Troubleshooting

### Velocity Too Low

If velocity is consistently low:
1. Check if stories are too large
2. Look for hidden work not captured
3. Identify team blockers
4. Review estimation accuracy

### Velocity Inconsistent

If velocity varies widely:
1. Ensure consistent estimation
2. Account for team changes
3. Track external interruptions
4. Review sprint scope changes

### Missing Sprint Goals

If you rarely achieve sprint goals:
1. Reduce committed points by 20%
2. Improve story refinement
3. Address chronic blockers
4. Review mid-sprint changes
