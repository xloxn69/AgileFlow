# Mobile Specialist

AG-MOBILE is the cross-platform mobile development specialist, handling React Native and Flutter implementation, native module integration, and mobile-specific optimization.

## Capabilities

- **React Native & Flutter Development**: Write once, deploy to iOS and Android
- **Native Module Integration**: Camera, location, notifications, sensors, storage
- **Mobile UI Patterns**: Tab navigation, stack navigation, modals, gestures, responsive design
- **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size targeting, memory management, battery optimization
- **Mobile Testing**: Device testing, emulator testing, slow network testing
- **Platform Abstraction**: Handle iOS/Android differences with reusable components
- **Mobile Analytics & Crash Reporting**: Sentry, Bugsnag, performance monitoring

## When to Use

Use AG-MOBILE when:

- Implementing cross-platform mobile features in React Native or Flutter
- Building native module integrations (camera, location, sensors)
- Optimizing mobile performance (bundle size, memory, battery)
- Handling platform-specific code and differences
- Testing on real devices
- Implementing mobile-specific UI patterns (bottom tabs, modals)
- Setting up app store deployment

## How It Works

1. **Context Loading**: Reads expertise file and project mobile strategy (React Native vs Flutter)
2. **Platform Analysis**: Determines what platform differences exist and how to abstract them
3. **Design & Implementation**: Creates cross-platform components with proper abstraction layers
4. **Testing**: Tests on both iOS and Android devices (not just emulators)
5. **Optimization**: Measures and optimizes bundle size, memory, and battery usage
6. **Coordination**: Updates status.json and coordinates with AG-UI on shared components

## Example

```bash
# Via /babysit
/agileflow:babysit
> "I need to add camera functionality to the mobile app that works on iOS and Android"

# AG-MOBILE will:
# 1. Research platform-specific camera APIs
# 2. Create abstraction layer for camera access
# 3. Implement on React Native (or Flutter)
# 4. Test on real iOS device
# 5. Test on real Android device
# 6. Document setup and usage
```

## Key Behaviors

- **Platform Abstraction**: Never writes platform-specific code without abstraction layer
- **Real Device Testing**: Always tests on real devices, not just emulators
- **Performance Budgets**: Stays within performance targets (battery, memory, bundle size)
- **Mobile Patterns**: Uses appropriate mobile UI patterns (bottom tabs, not sidebars)
- **Cross-platform Parity**: Ensures feature works identically on iOS and Android

## Tools Available

- Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
- Access to Session Harness for verification

## Mobile Platforms

**React Native**:
- JavaScript/TypeScript + native modules
- Expo (managed) or bare (unmanaged) workflows
- Shared React knowledge with web team

**Flutter**:
- Dart language with Material Design and Cupertino widgets
- Hot reload for fast development
- Strong performance characteristics

## Mobile Performance

Target these metrics:

- **Bundle Size**: Less than 2MB for fast downloads
- **Memory**: Avoid large objects, clean up properly (2-6GB typical RAM)
- **Battery**: Minimize network, CPU, and screen usage
- **Data**: Compress images, limit requests
- **Network**: Test on slow/unreliable networks

## Quality Checklist

Before marking mobile work complete:

- Implemented on both iOS and Android
- Mobile UX patterns appropriate
- Navigation flows tested
- Gestures handled correctly
- Platform-specific code abstracted
- Native modules (if any) integrated
- Performance targets met (bundle size, memory)
- Tested on real devices
- Tested on slow network
- App store requirements met (icons, splash screens)
- Tests passing with test_status: "passing"
