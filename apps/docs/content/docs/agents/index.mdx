# Agents

AgileFlow includes **25+ specialized agents**, each an expert in their domain. Agents can be spawned by the `/babysit` mentor or invoked directly using the Task tool.

## How Agents Work

1. **Expertise-First**: Each agent loads their expertise file to understand your codebase patterns
2. **Context-Aware**: Agents read project docs, status.json, and recent changes
3. **Collaborative**: Agents communicate via the message bus and update story status
4. **Self-Improving**: Agents update their expertise after completing work

## Agent Categories

### Core Development

The primary agents for building features:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`mentor`](/agents/mentor) | End-to-end implementation guidance from idea to PR |
| [`epic-planner`](/agents/epic-planner) | Break down features into epics and stories |
| [`database`](/agents/database) | Schema design, migrations, query optimization |
| [`api`](/agents/api) | Backend services, business logic, data layer |
| [`ui`](/agents/ui) | Frontend components, styling, accessibility |

### Quality & Testing

Agents focused on code quality:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`testing`](/agents/testing) | Test strategy, patterns, coverage optimization |
| [`qa`](/agents/qa) | Test planning, quality metrics, release readiness |
| [`security`](/agents/security) | Vulnerability analysis, auth patterns, compliance |
| [`performance`](/agents/performance) | Optimization, profiling, benchmarking |
| [`accessibility`](/agents/accessibility) | WCAG compliance, assistive technology support |

### Infrastructure

Agents for DevOps and operations:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`devops`](/agents/devops) | Deployment setup, testing infrastructure, quality checks |
| [`ci`](/agents/ci) | CI/CD workflows, linting, type checking, coverage |
| [`monitoring`](/agents/monitoring) | Observability, logging, alerting, dashboards |
| [`datamigration`](/agents/datamigration) | Zero-downtime migrations, data validation, rollback |

### Documentation & Research

Agents for knowledge management:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`documentation`](/agents/documentation) | Technical docs, API docs, user guides |
| [`research`](/agents/research) | Gathering information, research notes, best practices |
| [`adr-writer`](/agents/adr-writer) | Architecture Decision Records |
| [`readme-updater`](/agents/readme-updater) | Auditing and updating documentation files |

### Specialized Domains

Agents for specific use cases:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`mobile`](/agents/mobile) | React Native, Flutter, cross-platform mobile |
| [`integrations`](/agents/integrations) | Third-party APIs, webhooks, payment processors |
| [`analytics`](/agents/analytics) | Event tracking, metrics dashboards, data analysis |
| [`compliance`](/agents/compliance) | GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, audit trails |
| [`design`](/agents/design) | UI/UX design systems, visual design, patterns |

### Meta Agents

Agents that coordinate other agents:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`multi-expert`](/agents/multi-expert) | Deploys 3-5 experts on the same problem for high-confidence answers |
| [`product`](/agents/product) | Requirements analysis, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| [`refactor`](/agents/refactor) | Technical debt cleanup, legacy code modernization |

## Spawning Agents

### Via /babysit (Recommended)

The `/babysit` mentor automatically detects which agent is needed:

```bash
/agileflow:babysit
# Then describe your task - babysit will spawn the right agent
```

### Direct Spawning

You can also spawn agents directly using the Task tool:

```
Task(
  description: "Design user sessions schema",
  prompt: "Create a sessions table to track user logins with proper indexes",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-database"
)
```

### Parallel Agents

For full-stack features, spawn multiple agents simultaneously:

```
# API work
Task(subagent_type: "agileflow-api", run_in_background: true, ...)

# UI work (runs in parallel)
Task(subagent_type: "agileflow-ui", run_in_background: true, ...)
```

## Agent Communication

Agents coordinate through `docs/09-agents/`:

<FileTree>
  <Folder name="docs">
    <Folder name="09-agents">
      <File name="status.json" comment="Story statuses and assignments" />
      <Folder name="bus">
        <File name="log.jsonl" comment="Agent messages and handoffs" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

### Status Updates

Agents update `status.json` as they work:

```json
{
  "stories": {
    "US-0042": {
      "status": "in-progress",
      "owner": "AG-DATABASE",
      "summary": "Created sessions table with indexes"
    }
  }
}
```

### Message Bus

Agents log coordination messages:

```json
{"timestamp": "2025-12-24T10:00:00Z", "type": "assign", "story": "US-0042", "owner": "AG-DATABASE"}
{"timestamp": "2025-12-24T11:00:00Z", "type": "handoff", "story": "US-0042", "from": "AG-DATABASE", "to": "AG-API"}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Let babysit choose**: The mentor knows which agent fits best
2. **Provide context**: Tell agents about existing patterns in your codebase
3. **Review updates**: Check status.json changes agents make
4. **Use multi-expert for uncertainty**: When you need high confidence, deploy multiple experts
