# Agents

AgileFlow includes **28 specialized agents**, each an expert in their domain. Agents can be spawned by the `/babysit` mentor or invoked directly using the Task tool.

## How Agents Work

1. **Expertise-First**: Each agent loads their expertise file to understand your codebase patterns
2. **Context-Aware**: Agents read project docs, status.json, and recent changes
3. **Context Preservation**: Enhanced agents use compact_context configuration to preserve critical knowledge during conversation compaction
4. **Collaborative**: Agents communicate via the message bus and update story status
5. **Self-Improving**: Agents update their expertise after completing work

## Compact Context Feature

To maintain focus during long conversations, AgileFlow agents use **compact_context** configuration to preserve critical information when context is automatically compacted. This ensures agents don't lose important rules, state, and priorities mid-conversation.

### How It Works

Each agent has a `compact_context` configuration with three components:

**Priority Level**: Determines how aggressively the agent's context is preserved
- `critical` - Always preserved (highest priority agents like mentor, api, ui)
- `high` - Preserved in most compactions (important agents)
- `medium` - Preserved when possible (standard agents)
- `low` - First to be removed (rare, used for advisory agents)

**Preserve Rules**: Core behavioral rules that must never be lost
- Agent identity and role
- Critical constraints and safety rules
- Must-follow procedures (e.g., "Load expertise first")
- State management requirements
- Coordination protocols

**State Fields**: Dynamic state that changes during work
- Current story being implemented (US-#### ID)
- Task progress and completion percentage
- Known blockers and dependencies
- Next prioritized actions
- Test/build status

### Example Configuration

```yaml
compact_context:
  priority: critical
  preserve_rules:
    - "LOAD EXPERTISE FIRST: Read packages/cli/src/core/experts/api/expertise.yaml"
    - "VERIFY TEST BASELINE: Check test_status before starting"
    - "PRIORITIZE AG-UI BLOCKERS: Unblock UI stories waiting on API endpoints"
    - "DIFF-FIRST APPROACH: Show edits with confirmation before applying"
  state_fields:
    - current_story
    - endpoints_implemented
    - blocked_ui_stories
    - test_status_baseline
```

When Claude Code compresses context, it preserves these rules and state fields for all agents, ensuring continuity even after multiple rounds of conversation compaction.

### Agent Priority Distribution

- **Critical** (2 agents): mentor, api
- **High** (8 agents): ui, database, ci, devops, testing, security, documentation, performance
- **Medium** (15 agents): database, datamigration, qa, accessibility, monitoring, research, adr-writer, analytics, integrations, mobile, design, compliance, refactor, product, readme-updater
- **Low** (2 agents): epic-planner, orchestrator

This tiered approach ensures the most critical agents always maintain focus while others gracefully degrade context when needed.

| [`readme-updater`](/agents/readme-updater) | Auditing and updating documentation files |

### Specialized Domains

| [`compliance`](/agents/compliance) | GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, audit trails |
| [`design`](/agents/design) | UI/UX design systems, visual design, patterns |

### Meta Agents

Agents that coordinate other agents:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`multi-expert`](/agents/multi-expert) | Deploys 3-5 experts on the same problem for high-confidence answers |
| [`product`](/agents/product) | Requirements analysis, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| [`refactor`](/agents/refactor) | Technical debt cleanup, legacy code modernization |

## Spawning Agents

### Via /babysit (Recommended)

The `/babysit` mentor automatically detects which agent is needed:

```bash
/agileflow:babysit
# Then describe your task - babysit will spawn the right agent
```

### Direct Spawning

You can also spawn agents directly using the Task tool:

```text
Task(
  description: "Design user sessions schema",
  prompt: "Create a sessions table to track user logins with proper indexes",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-database"
)
```

### Parallel Agents

For full-stack features, spawn multiple agents simultaneously:

```text
# API work
Task(subagent_type: "agileflow-api", run_in_background: true, ...)

# UI work (runs in parallel)
Task(subagent_type: "agileflow-ui", run_in_background: true, ...)
```

## Agent Communication

Agents coordinate through `docs/09-agents/`:

<FileTree>
  <Folder name="docs">
    <Folder name="09-agents">
      <File name="status.json" comment="Story statuses and assignments" />
      <Folder name="bus">
        <File name="log.jsonl" comment="Agent messages and handoffs" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

### Status Updates

Agents update `status.json` as they work:

```json
{
  "stories": {
    "US-0042": {
      "status": "in-progress",
      "owner": "AG-DATABASE",
      "summary": "Created sessions table with indexes"
    }
  }
}
```

### Message Bus

Agents log coordination messages:

```json
{"timestamp": "2025-12-24T10:00:00Z", "type": "assign", "story": "US-0042", "owner": "AG-DATABASE"}
{"timestamp": "2025-12-24T11:00:00Z", "type": "handoff", "story": "US-0042", "from": "AG-DATABASE", "to": "AG-API"}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Let babysit choose**: The mentor knows which agent fits best
2. **Provide context**: Tell agents about existing patterns in your codebase
3. **Review updates**: Check status.json changes agents make
4. **Use multi-expert for uncertainty**: When you need high confidence, deploy multiple experts
