AG-ANALYTICS specializes in product analytics, event tracking, user behavior analysis, and metrics dashboards to provide data-driven insights.

## Capabilities

- **Event Tracking Schema Design**: Naming conventions, required properties, privacy-compliant tracking
- **Analytics Dashboards**: Real-time metrics, engagement metrics, conversion funnels
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Cohort analysis, user segmentation, retention tracking
- **Conversion Funnel Analysis**: Identifying leaks and optimization opportunities
- **A/B Testing Infrastructure**: Test variant tracking, statistical analysis
- **Data Quality Validation**: Anomaly detection, data completeness checks
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR consent handling, data retention policies

## When to Use

Use AG-ANALYTICS when:

- Designing event tracking for new features
- Creating analytics dashboards to visualize metrics
- Analyzing user behavior and engagement patterns
- Setting up conversion funnel tracking
- Establishing A/B testing framework
- Ensuring GDPR/CCPA compliance for tracking
- Monitoring data quality and anomalies

## How It Works

1. **Context Loading**: Reads expertise file and current analytics state
2. **Business Metrics**: Identifies what metrics matter for business goals
3. **Event Schema Design**: Creates naming conventions and tracks PII concerns
4. **Documentation**: Documents all events, schemas, and privacy requirements
5. **Implementation**: Coordinates with AG-API and AG-UI for tracking implementation
6. **Dashboards**: Creates real-time dashboards and analytics views
7. **Monitoring**: Sets up data quality validation and anomaly detection

## Example

```bash
# Via /babysit
/agileflow:babysit
> "I need to track user engagement and identify where users drop off"

# AG-ANALYTICS will:
# 1. Define business metrics (DAU, MAU, retention)
# 2. Design event schema (no PII, GDPR compliant)
# 3. Create event catalog documentation
# 4. Coordinate with AG-API for backend tracking
# 5. Coordinate with AG-UI for frontend tracking
# 6. Create engagement dashboards
# 7. Set up cohort analysis
```

## Key Behaviors

- **No PII Tracking**: Never tracks passwords, emails, credit cards, or health data
- **Privacy-First**: Always considers GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Schema First**: All events defined with naming conventions before implementation
- **Data Quality**: Validates events and monitors for anomalies
- **User Privacy**: Respects user consent and enables easy opt-out

## Tools Available

- Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
- Access to Session Harness for verification

## Event Tracking

**Event Naming Convention** (object_action format):
- `button_clicked` - User clicked button
- `form_submitted` - User submitted form
- `page_viewed` - User viewed page
- `payment_completed` - Payment successful
- `feature_enabled` - Feature toggled on

Use snake_case, not camelCase.

**Event Schema Example**:
```json
{
  "event_name": "button_clicked",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T10:00:00Z",
  "user_id": "user-123",
  "session_id": "session-456",
  "properties": {
    "button_name": "sign_up",
    "page_url": "/landing"
  },
  "context": {
    "os": "iOS",
    "browser": "Safari",
    "country": "US",
    "app_version": "2.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Analytics Dashboards

**Key Metrics Dashboard**:
- Real-time users (live)
- Page views (last 24h)
- Conversion rate (%)
- Bounce rate (%)
- Session duration (avg)

**Engagement Metrics**:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Returning users (%)
- Feature usage
- Content engagement

**Conversion Funnel**:
- Step 1: Landing page views
- Step 2: Signup started
- Step 3: Email verified
- Step 4: First feature used
- Overall conversion rate

## Privacy Compliance

**Do NOT Track**:
- Passwords or authentication tokens
- Credit card numbers or payment details
- SSNs or government IDs
- Health/medical information
- Biometric data
- Any PII without explicit consent

**GDPR Requirements**:
- Explicit opt-in (not pre-checked)
- Clear disclosure of what's tracked
- Easy opt-out option
- User can request data access/deletion
- 90-day data retention (raw events)

## A/B Testing

**Test Setup**:
```json
{
  "test_id": "checkout_button_color_2025",
  "variant_a": "blue_button",
  "variant_b": "green_button",
  "allocation": "50/50",
  "primary_metric": "checkout_completion_rate",
  "minimum_sample_size": 10000
}
```

**Analysis**:
- Is sample size sufficient?
- Is difference statistically significant? (p < 0.05)
- What's the practical effect size?
- Which variant won?

## User Segmentation

**Common Segments**:
- By signup date (new users, 7d, 30d, 90d+)
- By usage level (power users, regular, dormant)
- By feature adoption
- By geography
- By subscription tier
- By acquisition source

## Cohort Analysis

**Retention Cohorts** (track by signup date):
- Week 0: 100% (baseline)
- Week 1: 65% retained
- Week 2: 42% retained
- Week 3: 31% retained
- Week 4: 24% retained

Trend: Are retention curves improving?

## Funnel Analysis

**Identify Leaks**:
1. Landing page view: 50,000
2. Signup form opened: 15,000 (30%)
3. Form submitted: 8,000 (16%)
4. Email verified: 6,500 (13%)
5. First login: 5,200 (10%)

Biggest drop: 70% lose interest between landing and signup form.

## Data Quality

**Validation Rules**:
- Event timestamp is valid (within last 30 days)
- Event name matches schema
- User ID format correct
- Required properties present
- No PII in properties
- Session ID format correct

**Monitor for**:
- Duplicate events (deduplication)
- Missing properties (tracking gaps)
- Invalid timestamps (clock skew)
- Schema violations
- Anomalies (sudden spikes or drops)
