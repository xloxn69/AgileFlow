# Documentation Agent

The Documentation Agent (AG-DOCUMENTATION) is your specialist for technical writing, API documentation, user guides, and keeping documentation current with your codebase. This agent ensures that all documentation stays up-to-date, clear, and helpful for both new and experienced developers.

## Capabilities

- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, and error codes
- **User Guides & Tutorials**: Getting started guides, step-by-step instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting
- **Developer Guides**: Project setup, development workflow, architecture overview, and extension patterns
- **README Management**: Root, module-specific, and feature-specific README files
- **Changelog Maintenance**: Release notes and user-facing change tracking
- **Documentation Audits**: Identify outdated content, broken links, and missing examples
- **Auto-Generated Docs**: Support for OpenAPI Generator, TypeDoc/JSDoc, and architecture diagrams

## When to Use

Use this agent when you need to:

- Write or update API documentation with working examples
- Create user guides for new features (step-by-step instructions)
- Update README files to reflect current project state
- Write developer onboarding guides
- Create troubleshooting guides and FAQs for common issues
- Document architecture decisions and system design
- Maintain changelog with release notes
- Fix broken documentation links
- Audit documentation for staleness and accuracy
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes

## How It Works

1. **Context Loading**: Agent reads expertise file (documentation patterns, file locations, conventions) and analyzes project structure (CLAUDE.md, status.json, recent releases)

2. **Documentation Audit**: Agent identifies documentation gaps, outdated sections, broken links, and missing examples by scanning docs/ structure and comparing against code

3. **Planning**: Agent proposes documentation improvements, suggests new guides, identifies stale content, and prioritizes work

4. **Writing**: Agent creates/updates documentation with clarity prioritized over brevity, includes working examples (copy-paste ready), and maintains consistent formatting

5. **Quality Review**: Agent verifies documentation is up-to-date with code, all steps explained, examples work, and navigation between docs is clear

6. **Coordination**: Agent updates status.json, appends completion messages, and posts updates to agent bus

## Example

```bash
# Via /babysit
/agileflow:babysit
> "We just released v2.17.0. Need to update the changelog and API docs for the new endpoints"
```

The Documentation Agent would:
1. Check the new API endpoints added in v2.17.0
2. Update API documentation with request/response examples
3. Add release notes to changelog highlighting user-facing changes
4. Update README if needed
5. Verify all links work

## Key Behaviors

- **Documentation Priority**: Clarity over brevity - explains everything for new users
- **Always Include Examples**: Documentation without examples is useless; all examples are copy-paste ready
- **Keep Current**: Documentation must stay current with code; stale docs are worse than no docs
- **Include Troubleshooting**: Address common issues users will encounter
- **Document Breaking Changes**: Critical for users upgrading versions
- **Link Checking**: Proactively fixes broken documentation links
- **Consistency**: Maintains consistent formatting, tone, and structure across all docs
- **Context Preservation**: Uses compact_context (priority: high) to maintain focus during long conversations, preserving documentation coverage tracking and link validation through context compaction

## Compact Context Configuration

The Documentation agent uses **high priority** compact_context to ensure documentation quality stays in focus:

```yaml
compact_context:
  priority: high
  preserve_rules:
    - "LOAD EXPERTISE FIRST: Always read packages/cli/src/core/experts/documentation/expertise.yaml"
    - "NEVER LET DOCS LAG BEHIND CODE: Stale docs are worse than no docs (misinformation)"
    - "ALWAYS INCLUDE EXAMPLES: Documentation without examples is useless"
    - "KEEP LINKS CURRENT: Run link checker, fix broken references"
    - "DOCUMENT BREAKING CHANGES: Critical for users upgrading versions"
    - "CLARITY OVER BREVITY: Explain everything for new users"
  state_fields:
    - current_story
    - documentation_coverage
    - broken_links_count
    - outdated_sections
```

This ensures documentation-critical rules (keeping docs current, including examples, documentation completeness) and current state (what docs are outdated, which links are broken) persist through context compaction.

## Tools Available

This agent has access to:
- **Read**: Browse documentation files and understand structure
- **Write**: Create new documentation files
- **Edit**: Update existing documentation
- **Bash**: Run link checkers, validate documentation structure
- **Glob**: Find documentation files by pattern
- **Grep**: Search documentation content and identify broken links

## Quality Checklist

Before documenting:
- Documentation is up-to-date with code
- All new features documented with examples
- API documentation includes working examples
- Links are not broken
- Formatting is consistent across files
- Examples are working and copy-paste ready
- Troubleshooting section addresses common issues
- Navigation between docs is clear
- README is accurate and helpful
- No deprecated information remains

## Related Agents

- [`research`](/agents/research) - Gathers technical information for documentation
- [`adr-writer`](/agents/adr-writer) - Documents architectural decisions referenced in guides
- [`epic-planner`](/agents/epic-planner) - Creates epics that documentation ensures are properly documented
- [`readme-updater`](/agents/readme-updater) - Audits and updates README files across project folders

## Common Patterns

**Documentation-as-Code**
- All documentation versioned with code in git
- Source of truth is the living codebase, not separate docs
- Changes to code trigger documentation updates

**Numbered Directory Structure**
- Documentation organized in docs/ with numbered directories (00-meta through 10-research)
- Consistent structure across all projects

**Documentation Maintenance**
- Schedule quarterly audits to find stale information
- After every release, update documentation
- After every API change, update API docs
- Fix broken links proactively

## Coordination Messages

The Documentation Agent communicates with other agents via bus messages:

```jsonl
{"ts":"2025-10-21T10:00:00Z","from":"AG-DOCUMENTATION","type":"status","text":"API docs updated for v2.17.0"}
{"ts":"2025-10-21T10:05:00Z","from":"AG-DOCUMENTATION","type":"question","text":"UI component API changed - need updated documentation for props"}
```

When other agents complete work:
- AG-API completes endpoint → Documentation Agent updates API docs
- AG-UI releases component → Documentation Agent documents component props and usage
- Release happens → Documentation Agent updates changelog and release notes
- Architecture decision made → Documentation Agent updates ADR documentation
