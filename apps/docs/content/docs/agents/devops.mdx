# AG-DEVOPS

The DevOps & Automation Agent specializes in infrastructure automation, dependency management, and deployment pipelines. AG-DEVOPS ensures projects maintain high code quality, manage security vulnerabilities, and deploy with confidence.

## Capabilities

- **Dependency Management**: Security audits, version tracking, vulnerability fixes, license compliance
- **Deployment Automation**: CI/CD pipeline setup, staging/production configuration, zero-downtime deployments
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Test framework setup, optimization, performance testing
- **Code Quality Automation**: Linting, formatting, code review bots, coverage tracking
- **Impact Analysis**: Dependency trees, blast radius assessment, change impact evaluation
- **Technical Debt Management**: Debt scoring, prioritization, reduction tracking
- **Documentation Synchronization**: API docs, README files, changelog maintenance
- **Changelog Generation**: Semantic versioning, automated release notes
- **Stakeholder Reporting**: Status updates, metrics, progress tracking

## When to Use

Use AG-DEVOPS when you need to:

- Update dependencies or conduct security audits
- Set up or optimize CI/CD pipelines
- Configure testing infrastructure and coverage
- Automate code quality checks
- Analyze impact of changes on the codebase
- Track and reduce technical debt
- Generate changelogs and release notes
- Create stakeholder reports and status updates

## How It Works

1. **Context Loading**: Agent reads expertise file and checks project dependency health
2. **Analysis**: Reviews status.json for assigned stories and technical debt
3. **Execution**: Implements automation, updates configurations, or creates pipelines
4. **Verification**: Runs tests, validates CI passes, confirms no regressions
5. **Coordination**: Updates status.json and communicates via agent bus

## Example

```bash
# Via /babysit
/agileflow:babysit
> "We need to set up a deployment pipeline for staging and production"

# Or directly invoke
/agileflow:setup-deployment

# AG-DEVOPS will:
# 1. Detect project type (Node.js, Python, etc.)
# 2. Recommend deployment platform (GitHub Actions, etc.)
# 3. Configure CI/CD pipelines
# 4. Set up environment variables
# 5. Document procedures
```

## Key Behaviors

- **Critical vulnerabilities addressed within 24 hours** - Security is non-negotiable
- **Zero-downtime deployments required** - Production stability is essential
- **Never commits secrets** - All credentials managed via secure channels
- **Maintains 70% minimum test coverage** - Enforced in CI
- **Plan before infrastructure changes** - Design rollback strategies for complex changes
- **Proactive audits** - Regularly scans for technical debt and optimization opportunities

## Tools Available

This agent has access to:

- **Read**: Access project files and configurations
- **Write**: Create new automation scripts and configuration files
- **Edit**: Update existing CI/CD workflows and settings
- **Bash**: Execute build, test, and deployment commands
- **Glob**: Find configuration and dependency files
- **Grep**: Search for patterns in code and configs
- **WebFetch**: Research tools and best practices
- **WebSearch**: Find solution documentation

## Core Responsibilities

1. Manage project dependencies (updates, security audits, reporting)
2. Set up and maintain deployment pipelines
3. Configure testing infrastructure
4. Automate code quality checks
5. Analyze impact of code changes
6. Track and prioritize technical debt
7. Keep documentation synced with code
8. Generate changelogs from commits/PRs
9. Create stakeholder update reports
10. Maintain custom document templates

## Quality Standards

Before marking work complete, AG-DEVOPS ensures:

- All automation scripts tested and working
- CI/CD pipelines passing on feature branch
- Documentation updated alongside code
- Secrets managed securely (no hardcoded credentials)
- No breaking changes without migration guide
- Rollback procedures documented
- Monitoring/alerting configured where applicable

## Related Agents

- [`AG-CI`](/agents/ci) - Handles test framework setup and quality tools while AG-DEVOPS manages deployment automation
- [`AG-UI`](/agents/ui) - Coordinate on dependency updates affecting frontend
- [`AG-API`](/agents/api) - Coordinate on deployment timing and database migrations
- [`MENTOR`](/agents/mentor) - Report on technical debt trends and automation opportunities

## Slash Commands

AG-DEVOPS can directly invoke these commands:

- `/agileflow:packages ACTION=update` - Scan and update dependencies
- `/agileflow:packages ACTION=dashboard` - Generate dependency health report
- `/agileflow:setup-deployment` - Configure CI/CD pipelines
- `/agileflow:setup-tests` - Bootstrap test infrastructure
- `/agileflow:ai-code-review` - Automated code review
- `/agileflow:impact-analysis` - Analyze change impact
- `/agileflow:tech-debt` - Scan and track technical debt
- `/agileflow:docs-sync` - Keep docs in sync with code
- `/agileflow:generate-changelog` - Auto-generate changelog
- `/agileflow:stakeholder-update` - Create executive summary

## Verification Protocol

AG-DEVOPS follows the Session Harness system to prevent breaking functionality:

1. **Pre-Implementation**: Checks baseline test status and environment
2. **During Work**: Runs incremental tests, updates status in real-time
3. **Post-Implementation**: Verifies all tests pass before marking stories complete
4. **Story Completion**: Can ONLY mark "in-review" if `test_status: "passing"`

See the [Session Harness Protocol](/agents/session-harness) for complete details.
