# /blockers

Analyze and track all blockers across the project with categorization, root cause analysis, and actionable resolution suggestions.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:blockers
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AGENT` | No | - | Filter to specific agent (e.g., AG-UI, AG-API) |
| `SHOW_RESOLVED` | No | false | Include recently resolved blockers (last 7 days) |
| `DETAILED` | No | false | Show extended details with ADR and research links |

## Examples

### View All Blockers

```bash
/agileflow:blockers
```

Display all active blockers across all agents with summary stats and suggested actions.

### Filter by Agent

```bash
/agileflow:blockers AGENT=AG-UI
```

Show only blockers affecting the UI team.

### Include Resolved Blockers

```bash
/agileflow:blockers SHOW_RESOLVED=true
```

Display both active and recently resolved blockers (last 7 days) to track unblocking progress.

### View Full Details

```bash
/agileflow:blockers DETAILED=true
```

Show extended information including related ADRs, research notes, and resolution recommendations.

## Blocker Categories

Blockers are categorized by type to help identify resolution patterns:

### Technical Blockers
Missing APIs, infrastructure, or dependencies that aren't complete. Often unblock when dependent story completes.

**Example**: AG-UI blocked waiting for AG-API to implement `/auth/login` endpoint

**Resolution**: Check if AG-API story is in-progress, estimate completion time, or use mock data as workaround.

### Coordination Blockers
Waiting on other agents or requiring handoff. Requires cross-team communication.

**Example**: AG-UI blocked waiting on AG-API priority decision

**Resolution**: Schedule sync, clarify priorities, or redistribute work to balance capacity.

### Clarification Blockers
Requirements unclear or acceptance criteria incomplete. Can't proceed without more information.

**Example**: Deployment target unclear (Vercel vs AWS vs Docker)

**Resolution**: Ask specific questions, check epic goals, or create spike story for investigation.

### External Blockers
Third-party service, approval, or access required. Often outside team control.

**Example**: Waiting for payment gateway API keys from vendor

**Resolution**: Escalate to stakeholder, document assumptions to work in parallel.

### Capacity Blockers
Team member at WIP limit and can't start new stories. Others waiting for their availability.

**Example**: AG-API at 2/2 stories, 3 ready stories waiting

**Resolution**: Redistribute to other agents, focus on completing current work, or add team capacity.

### Research Blockers
Need investigation before proceeding. Stale research may need updating.

**Example**: Deployment comparison research outdated (90+ days old)

**Resolution**: Run `/agileflow:context MODE=research` for current best practices, update research notes.

### Critical Blockers Section

Blockers stale for >14 days requiring immediate attention:

```
🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (>14 days)
-------------------------------
US-0051 | AG-DEVOPS | Blocked for 16 days
  Reason: Unclear deployment target
  Impact: Blocking EP-0012 CI/CD Pipeline (10% complete)

  💡 Resolution:
     - Ask stakeholder: Which platform? (Vercel, AWS, Docker)
     - Related research: docs/10-research/deployment-comparison.md (90 days old)
     - Suggest: /agileflow:context MODE=research TOPIC="Modern deployment 2025"
```

### Active Blockers Section

Grouped by category with resolution suggestions and estimated unblock times.

### Capacity Blockers Section

Agents at WIP limit with stories waiting:

```
💪 CAPACITY BLOCKERS
--------------------
AG-API at WIP limit (2/2):
  - US-0038 (in-progress, est. 1d remaining)
  - US-0041 (in-progress, est. 2d remaining)

Ready stories waiting for AG-API: 3
  - US-0055 (EP-0011, est: 1d)
  - US-0060 (EP-0013, est: 2d)
  - US-0062 (EP-0010, est: 0.5d)

💡 Suggestion: Wait for US-0038 to complete (tomorrow),
   then pick up US-0062 (smallest and fastest win)
```

### Recently Resolved Section (if SHOW_RESOLVED=true)

```
✅ RECENTLY RESOLVED (last 7 days)
----------------------------------
2025-12-21 14:30 - AG-API unblocked US-0042: "POST /auth/login endpoint complete"
2025-12-20 09:15 - AG-UI unblocked US-0033: "Design system tokens extracted"
2025-12-19 16:45 - AG-CI unblocked US-0028: "Test environment configured"
```

### Action Items Section

Prioritized next steps with specific commands:

```
🎯 PRIORITIZED ACTIONS
----------------------
1. [High] Resolve US-0051 clarification blocker (16 days old)
   Command: /agileflow:status STORY=US-0051 STATUS=ready NOTE="Clarified: Vercel"

2. [High] Complete US-0038 (70% done, unblocks US-0042)
   Command: /agileflow:status STORY=US-0038 STATUS=in-review

3. [Medium] Update stale deployment research (90 days old)
   Command: /agileflow:context MODE=research TOPIC="Deployment platforms"

4. [Low] Redistribute AG-API backlog when capacity opens
   Command: /agileflow:assign STORY=US-0055 NEW_OWNER=AG-API
```

## Key Insights

The blocker command highlights:

- **Critical blockers** - Anything stale >14 days needs immediate action
- **Cross-agent blockers** - Shows AG-API ↔ AG-UI coordination opportunities
- **Capacity constraints** - Identifies bottlenecks in team capacity
- **Dependency chains** - Unblocking story A will free up stories B and C
- **Research gaps** - Shows when research is outdated and needs refresh

## Best Practices

1. **Check blockers daily** - During standup or in the morning
2. **Unblock immediately** - Don't let blockers sit longer than necessary
3. **Communicate blockers** - Update status as soon as blocked, not after
4. **Escalate critical** - Anything >7 days needs escalation
5. **Document root cause** - Help future reference with clear blocker reasons

## FAQ

<Accordion type="multiple">
  <AccordionItem value="detected">
    <AccordionTrigger>How is a blocker detected?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Blockers are identified by: stories with `status: "blocked"` in status.json, stories waiting on incomplete dependencies, agents at WIP limit with ready stories waiting, and stories unchanged for more than 14 days.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="types">
    <AccordionTrigger>How are blocker types determined?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Types are inferred from: `blocked_by` field text (contains keywords like "API", "approval", "unclear"), bus messages with blocker comments, story dependency chains, and epic context.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="spike">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I create a spike story to unblock research?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes, use `/story-new` to create a spike: `/story-new EPIC=EP-0012 TYPE=spike TITLE="Research modern deployment platforms"`
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="difference">
    <AccordionTrigger>What's the difference between blocked and WIP limit?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      **Blocked** means can't proceed (external dependency). **WIP limit** means agent is at capacity and should finish current work before starting more.
