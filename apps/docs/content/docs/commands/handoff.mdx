# /handoff

Document work handoffs between agents on a story with summary and blockers for smooth team collaboration.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:handoff STORY=US-0042 FROM=agent-a TO=agent-b SUMMARY="Completed API integration" BLOCKERS="Need database schema review"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `STORY` | Yes | - | Story ID (e.g., US-0042) |
| `FROM` | Yes | - | Handing off agent ID |
| `TO` | Yes | - | Receiving agent ID |
| `SUMMARY` | Yes | - | What was accomplished or current status |
| `BLOCKERS` | No | - | Known blockers or issues to communicate |

## Examples

### Basic Handoff

```bash
/agileflow:handoff STORY=US-0050 FROM=AG-API TO=AG-UI SUMMARY="Backend API complete and tested" BLOCKERS="UI styling needs brand color review"
```

Creates a handoff note documenting:
- Who is handing off the work
- What was completed
- Any known blockers for the next agent
- Date and time of handoff

### Handoff with Multiple Blockers

```bash
/agileflow:handoff STORY=US-0045 FROM=AG-CI TO=AG-DEVOPS SUMMARY="Pipeline setup complete, ready for deployment" BLOCKERS="Environment variables need to be set, Requires AWS credentials approval"
```

## Output

The command creates two artifacts:

### 1. Handoff Note

Creates a markdown file at:
```text
docs/09-agents/comms/<STORY>-<YYYYMMDD>-handoff.md
```

Example content:
```markdown
# Handoff: US-0042

From: AG-API
To: AG-UI
Date: 2025-12-22

## Summary
Completed API integration with authentication middleware.
All endpoints tested and passing.

## Blockers
- Database schema needs DBA review before migration
- Redis cache configuration pending DevOps approval
```

### 2. Agent Bus Log

Appends an entry to `docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl` with type `handoff` to create an audit trail of work transitions between agents.

## Workflow

1. Parse all inputs (STORY, FROM, TO, SUMMARY, BLOCKERS)
2. Generate handoff note from template
3. Append entry to agent bus log
4. Show preview for confirmation
5. Wait for YES/NO approval
6. Write files only after approval

## Use When

- **Switching agents** on a story mid-project
- **Pausing work** and documenting progress for later
- **Highlighting blockers** for the next agent
- **Creating audit trail** of work transitions
- **Documenting dependencies** for cross-team handoffs
