# /agileflow:skill:create

Generate dynamic, research-backed skills that combine web documentation, user's local docs, and codebase patterns.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:skill:create
```

Optionally provide a skill name hint:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:create supabase-swift
```

## How It Works

This command generates custom skills through comprehensive research of three sources:

1. **Web Documentation** - Official docs, API references, best practices
2. **Local Documentation** - Your project's practices and architecture decisions
3. **Codebase Patterns** - Existing code patterns and conventions in your project

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

The command asks what skill you'd like to create:

- Describe what you need
- Database integration (Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- API integration (REST APIs, GraphQL, webhooks)
- UI/Frontend (Components, styling, design systems)
- Development workflow (Testing, deployment, CI/CD)

You provide details about:
- Technology or framework
- Primary use cases
- Target workflow

### Phase 2: Plan Mode Research

The command enters plan mode to research:

**Web Documentation**
- Searches for official documentation and best practices
- Collects URLs (doesn't copy content)
- Finds GitHub repositories and tutorials

**Local Documentation**
- Scans your `docs/` directory for relevant practices
- Checks `docs/02-practices/` for development guidelines
- Looks at `docs/04-architecture/` for design decisions
- Finds existing documentation about the technology

**Codebase Patterns**
- Explores existing code for patterns
- Identifies design systems and component structures
- Finds database client setups and middleware patterns
- Documents error handling and styling approaches

**MCP Servers**
- Searches for Model Context Protocol servers for the technology
- Notes the package name and documentation

### Phase 3: Skill Generation

Based on research, the command generates:

**SKILL.md** - Main skill file containing:
- Activation triggers (when to use)
- Project context and local patterns
- Cookbook workflows for different use cases
- Quick reference table
- MCP integration (if available)
- Common mistakes to avoid

**references.md** - Complete documentation guide with:
- External documentation links
- Local project documentation
- Codebase patterns with code examples
- MCP server information

**cookbook/** - Use-case specific workflows:
- Prerequisites for each workflow
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples
- Troubleshooting guides

**.mcp.json** - MCP server configuration (if applicable)

### Phase 4: Preview & Confirmation

The command shows:
- Generated skill structure
- Preview of SKILL.md content
- Option to create, edit, or cancel

### Phase 5: File Creation

Once confirmed:
- Creates `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` directory
- Writes all files
- Verifies creation

## Generated Skill Structure

```
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file with activation triggers and cookbook
├── references.md         # Links to web docs, local docs, and code patterns
├── cookbook/             # Per-use-case workflows
│   ├── use-case-1.md
│   └── use-case-2.md
└── .mcp.json            # MCP server config (if applicable)
```

## Example Output

When creating a Supabase Swift skill:

```
🔍 Researching supabase-swift...

Found Web Documentation:
  • Supabase Swift SDK docs
  • API reference guide
  • GitHub repository

Found Local Documentation:
  • docs/02-practices/database.md
  • docs/04-architecture/data-layer.md

Found Codebase Patterns:
  • src/lib/supabase.ts (existing client setup)
  • src/models/ (database model patterns)

Found MCP Server:
  • @supabase/mcp-server

```

## Parameters

This command uses interactive prompts (AskUserQuestion) instead of command-line parameters.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Skill name | What you want to build (technology or domain) |
| Technology details | Framework, primary use cases |
| MCP integration | Whether to include MCP server if available |

## Skill Features

### Activation Triggers

Each skill includes "When to Use" section with keywords that trigger its use:

```
This skill activates when:
- Building Supabase features in Swift apps
- Need authentication or real-time data
- Keywords: "Supabase", "Swift", "database", "authentication"
```

### Cookbook Patterns

Multi-use-case skills include workflows for:

- CRUD operations
- Authentication
- Real-time subscriptions
- Data migrations
- Error handling

### MCP Integration

If an MCP server is found, the skill includes:
- Server configuration
- Tools provided by the server
- Setup instructions
- Copy-to-project guidance

## When to Create Skills

Create a custom skill when you need to:

- **Master a new technology** in your project context
- **Establish patterns** for a common workflow
- **Integrate external tools** with your codebase
- **Document domain expertise** for team consistency
- **Automate repetitive processes** with research-backed guidance

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names** - `supabase-swift` not just `database`
2. **Include cookbook entries** - Multiple use cases make skills reusable
3. **Link to local patterns** - Reference your project's conventions
4. **Add troubleshooting** - Anticipate common problems
5. **Update references** - Keep documentation links current

- [`/agileflow:skill:edit`](/commands/skill-edit) - Modify an existing skill
- [`/agileflow:skill:delete`](/commands/skill-delete) - Remove a skill
- [`/agileflow:skill:test`](/commands/skill-test) - Verify a skill works

## How Skills Are Used

After creation, the skill is stored in `.claude/skills/` and can be:

1. **Referenced in projects** - Copy the skill directory to another project
2. **Shared with teammates** - Commit to version control or share directly
3. **Tested and refined** - Use `/agileflow:skill:test` to validate
4. **Integrated with Claude Code** - Automatically loaded as context
5. **Exported and versioned** - Manage as part of your team's knowledge base

## Troubleshooting

### Web Search Returns No Results

- Ask you to provide a documentation URL
- Creates skill with generic patterns
- Includes note to review manually

### MCP Server Not Found

- Creates skill without `.mcp.json`
- Adds note in SKILL.md for manual MCP setup later
- Provides instructions for adding MCP configuration

### Validation Errors

Before writing files, the command validates:
- Skill name uses only letters, numbers, hyphens
- Description is under 1024 characters
- SKILL.md body is under 500 lines
- All referenced files exist

If errors occur, the command offers to fix automatically.
