description: Generate a custom skill with web research, cookbook pattern, and MCP integration
---

# /skill:create

Generate dynamic, research-backed skills that combine web documentation, your local docs, and codebase patterns.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
/agileflow:skill:create

# With skill name hint
/agileflow:skill:create supabase-swift
```

## What It Does

The `/skill:create` command creates custom skills by researching three sources and building research-backed workflows:

1. **Web Documentation** - Official docs, API references, tutorials
2. **Local Project Documentation** - Your practices, architecture decisions
3. **Codebase Patterns** - Existing code examples and conventions

It then generates:
- **SKILL.md** - Main skill file with activation triggers
- **references.md** - Links to all documentation sources
- **cookbook/** - Step-by-step workflows for different use cases
- **.mcp.json** - Optional MCP server configuration

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Requirements

You describe what skill you need:

```xml
Skill categories:
- Database integration (Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- API integration (REST, GraphQL, webhooks)
- UI/Frontend (Components, styling, design system)
- Development workflow (Testing, deployment, CI/CD)
- Custom description (describe what you need)
```

### Phase 2: Research

The command enters Plan Mode and researches:

- **Web docs**: Official documentation URLs, tutorials, guides
- **Local docs**: Files in your `docs/` directory matching the skill's domain
- **Codebase patterns**: Existing code showing how you do things
- **MCP servers**: Available tools for the technology

It collects URLs and patterns without copying content.

### Phase 3: Generation

Based on research findings, it generates:

- **SKILL.md** with activation triggers and cookbook references
- **references.md** linking all web/local/codebase sources
- **cookbook/** directory with one file per use case
- **.mcp.json** if an MCP server was found

### Phase 4: Confirmation

You see the generated structure, can preview content, and approve creation.

## Parameters

This command has no parameters - it's entirely interactive.

```bash
/agileflow:skill:create              # Interactive mode
/agileflow:skill:create my-skill     # Optional: suggest skill name
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a Supabase Skill

```bash
/agileflow:skill:create
```

**Your responses:**
```
What skill would you like to create?
> [Select "Database integration"]

Which database?
> Supabase

What language/framework?
> Swift iOS app

What use cases?
> Authentication, CRUD operations, Real-time subscriptions
```

**Generated structure:**
```
.claude/skills/supabase-swift/
├── SKILL.md (activation triggers, cookbook references)
├── references.md (links to Supabase docs, local patterns)
├── cookbook/
│   ├── authentication.md (sign up, sign in, sign out)
│   ├── crud-operations.md (create, read, update, delete)
│   └── realtime-subscriptions.md (listen to changes)
└── .mcp.json (Supabase MCP server config)
```

### Example 2: Create a React Components Skill

```bash
/agileflow:skill:create ui-components
```

**Interactive prompts:**
```
Describe what you need:
> Building reusable React components with accessibility and Tailwind CSS

Frameworks/libraries:
> React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

Use cases:
> Creating new components, styling patterns, making accessible
```

**Generated files include:**
- References to React docs, Tailwind docs, accessibility guidelines
- Codebase patterns from `src/components/`
- Cookbook entries for common component types

## Output

The command shows you:

1. **Research Summary** - What it found in each source
2. **Skill Structure** - Files that will be created
3. **Preview** - First 50 lines of SKILL.md
4. **Confirmation** - YES/NO to create

Example output:

```

## Best Practices

### Naming Skills

Use specific, descriptive names with hyphens:

- ✅ `supabase-swift` - Clear technology and context
- ✅ `react-components-accessible` - Framework and key feature
- ✅ `rest-api-error-handling` - Domain and focus
- ❌ `database` - Too vague
- ❌ `api` - Too generic
- ❌ `my_skill` - Use hyphens, not underscores

### Creating Effective Skills

1. **Use specific domains** - One technology per skill, not too broad
2. **Include multiple use cases** - Add cookbook entries for different scenarios
3. **Link to project patterns** - The references.md should point to your actual code
4. **Add troubleshooting** - Anticipate and address common issues
5. **Keep focused** - 2-4 cookbook entries per skill

### When to Create New Skills

Create a skill when:
- You use a technology frequently
- Your team has patterns for something
- You want to encode best practices
- You need step-by-step guidance

Don't create if:
- The topic is too narrow (one cookbook entry)
- You use it rarely
- External docs are sufficient

## Cookbook Entries

Cookbooks are step-by-step guides for specific use cases. Each skill can have multiple cookbooks.

### Cookbook Structure

```markdown
# Use Case Title

Brief description of this workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Prerequisite 1
- Prerequisite 2

## Instructions

1. **Step 1**: Description with example
   ```language
   code example
   ```

2. **Step 2**: Next step
   ```language
   code example
   ```

## Example

**Input**: Sample input or scenario
**Output**: Expected output

## Troubleshooting

- **Problem**: Solution
```

### Cookbook Examples

Each cookbook entry should address a specific, common task:

- **Supabase skill**:
  - `authentication.md` - Sign up, sign in, sign out
  - `crud-operations.md` - Create, read, update, delete
  - `realtime-subscriptions.md` - Listen to database changes

- **React components skill**:
  - `create-component.md` - Build a new component
  - `styling-patterns.md` - Apply consistent styles
  - `accessibility.md` - Make it accessible

## MCP Integration

If your skill's technology has an MCP server available, the command includes `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "${SUPABASE_URL}",
        "SUPABASE_KEY": "${SUPABASE_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This allows Claude to use MCP tools when working with the skill. You'll need to set environment variables for the tools to work.

## Error Handling

### Web Search Returns No Results

If documentation isn't found online:
- The command creates the skill with generic patterns
- You can manually add URLs to `references.md` later
- Use `/agileflow:skill:edit` to enhance it

### MCP Server Not Found

If no MCP server exists for your technology:
- The skill is created without `.mcp.json`
- You can add MCP later if a server becomes available
- Manual MCP setup instructions are provided

### Validation Errors

Before writing, the command validates:
- Skill name contains only letters, numbers, hyphens
- Description is under 1024 characters
- SKILL.md is under 500 lines
- All cookbook files are referenced

If validation fails, you'll be asked to fix before proceeding.

## After Creation

Once the skill is created:

1. **Test it**:
   ```bash
   /agileflow:skill:test supabase-swift
   ```

2. **Use it** - Work on tasks and the skill will activate automatically

3. **Add learning** - Enable self-improvement:
   ```bash
   /agileflow:skill:upgrade supabase-swift
   ```

4. **Improve it** - Correct Claude's output and the skill learns:
   ```bash
   /agileflow:skill:edit supabase-swift
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Working

If a newly created skill doesn't seem to activate:

1. Check "When to Use" section in SKILL.md
2. Make sure your question matches the activation triggers
3. Run `/agileflow:skill:test` to verify the structure
4. Edit with `/agileflow:skill:edit` to adjust triggers

### Missing Local Documentation

If the command can't find your local practices:

1. Create documentation in `docs/02-practices/` or `docs/04-architecture/`
2. Edit the skill to reference what you create
3. Use more specific keywords in your skill description

### Cookbook Entries Not Shown

If cookbook entries aren't visible in Claude Code:

1. Run `/agileflow:skill:test` to verify files exist
2. Check that SKILL.md references them correctly
3. Ensure cookbook files are valid Markdown

## Next Steps

1. Create your first skill: `/agileflow:skill:create`
2. Test it works: `/agileflow:skill:test`
