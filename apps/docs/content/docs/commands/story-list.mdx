## Interpreting Results

### Healthy Story Distribution

```
5 stories (1 done, 2 in_progress, 2 ready)
```

- ✅ People have work to do

### Potential Issues

**Too many in_progress (>3)**
```
5 stories (0 done, 4 in_progress, 1 ready)
```
- Consider reducing WIP (work in progress)
- Focus on completing stories

**No ready stories**
```
5 stories (2 done, 2 in_progress, 0 ready)
```
- Need to plan more stories
- Create `/agileflow:story` for next work items

**Lots of blocked**
```
7 stories (1 done, 1 in_progress, 3 blocked, 2 ready)
```
- Address blockers urgently
- May need to unblock dependencies
