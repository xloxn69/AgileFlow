# /session:resume

Switch to a different Claude Code session. Shows available sessions and provides the command to switch.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:session:resume
```

## How It Works

1. Lists all registered sessions with status
2. Presents interactive picker to select a session
3. Shows the terminal command to switch

## Example Interaction

```
Which session do you want to resume?

○ Session 1 (main) - /home/user/myproject [active]
○ Session 2 "auth" - /home/user/myproject-auth [active]
○ Session 3 - /home/user/myproject-3 [stale]
```

After selecting Session 2:

```
To resume Session 2 "auth":

  cd /home/user/myproject-auth && claude --resume

Note: Use a new terminal window/tab for best experience.
```

## Session States

| State | Can Resume? | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `active` | Yes | Another Claude instance is running there |
| `stale` | Yes | Previous session ended, directory still exists |
| `current` | No | You're already in this session |

## The --resume Flag

The `claude --resume` flag tells Claude Code to:
- Load conversation history from the previous session
- Restore context about what you were working on
- Continue where you left off

Without `--resume`, Claude starts with a fresh context.

## Workflow Examples

### Switching Between Tasks

```bash
# Currently in Session 1 working on feature A
/agileflow:session:resume
# Select Session 2 "auth"

# In new terminal:
cd /home/user/myproject-auth && claude --resume
# Continue auth work with full context
```

### Returning After Break

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# See: "2 other active sessions"
/agileflow:session:resume
# Pick the session you want to continue
```

### Cleaning Up Before Resume

If a session shows as stale:

```bash
/agileflow:session:status
# Session 3 shows "stale"

/agileflow:session:end
# Select Session 3 to clean up

/agileflow:session:resume
# Now switch to a clean session
```

## Terminal Tips

**Best practice**: Open a new terminal tab/window for each session.

```bash
# Tab 1: Session 1 (main project)
cd /home/user/myproject && claude

# Tab 2: Session 2 (auth feature)
cd /home/user/myproject-auth && claude --resume

# Tab 3: Session 3 (API work)
cd /home/user/myproject-3 && claude --resume
```
