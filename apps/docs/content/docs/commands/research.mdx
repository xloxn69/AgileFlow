# /research

Create and organize research notes with structured analysis to document findings, investigations, and learning from external sources.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:research
```

The command will guide you to create a new research note in `docs/10-research/`.

## How It Works

### What Gets Created

When you create a research note, the command:

1. **Creates the research folder** if it doesn't exist at `docs/10-research/`
2. **Creates an index** in `docs/10-research/README.md` with a table of all research notes
3. **Creates research file** at `docs/10-research/<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>.md` (newest first)
4. **Adds index entry** with Date, Topic, Path, and Summary

### File Format

Research notes are stored with ISO date prefixes:

<FileTree>
  <Folder name="docs">
    <Folder name="10-research">
      <File name="README.md" comment="Index table" />
      <File name="20251224-oauth-implementation-guide.md" />
      <File name="20251220-typescript-performance-tuning.md" />
      <File name="20251215-stripe-webhook-integration.md" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

## Examples

### Create a New Research Note

```bash
/agileflow:research
```

The command guides you through:

1. Creating the research folder structure
2. Pasting or providing research content
3. Extracting key findings
4. Generating a structured markdown file
5. Adding an entry to the index

### Typical Research Note Structure

Research notes follow a consistent template with these sections:

- **Header** - Title, date, topic, and source URL
- **Summary** - Brief overview of the research
- **Key Findings** - Bulleted list of important discoveries
- **Implementation Approach** - Step-by-step guidance
- **Security Considerations** - Security best practices
- **Testing Strategy** - How to test the implementation
- **Risks & Gotchas** - Common pitfalls to avoid
- **References** - Source links and citations

## Research Index

The `docs/10-research/README.md` maintains a table of all research:

```markdown
# Research Notes

| Date | Topic | Path | Summary |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| 2025-12-24 | OAuth 2.0 Implementation | 20251224-oauth-implementation-guide.md | OAuth 2.0 flows, security, and best practices for web apps |
| 2025-12-20 | TypeScript Performance | 20251220-typescript-performance-tuning.md | Optimization techniques and build configuration |
| 2025-12-15 | Stripe Webhooks | 20251215-stripe-webhook-integration.md | Webhook setup, security, and retry strategies |
```

## When to Use Research Notes

### Before Architecture Decisions
Research tools and frameworks before recommending them:

```bash
/agileflow:research
# Document findings about potential solutions
# Then create ADR referencing the research
```

### Feature Investigation
Deep-dive into how to implement complex features:

```bash
# Research authentication approach
# Research payment integration
# Research real-time synchronization
```

### Technology Evaluation
Compare options and document findings:

```bash
# Compare database options (PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB)
# Compare UI frameworks (React vs. Vue vs. Svelte)
# Compare hosting platforms (Vercel vs. AWS vs. Heroku)
```

### Learning & Training
Document learnings from courses, tutorials, or documentation:

```bash
# Summarize conference talk
# Document tutorial findings
# Capture best practices from book
```

## Best Practices

### Research Title Format
Use descriptive, specific titles:

```
Good:
- OAuth 2.0 Implementation for Web Applications
- PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for Real-time Data
- Next.js App Router Optimization Techniques

Avoid:
- Research Notes
- How to do stuff
- Random findings
```

### Include Sources
Always cite where information came from:

```markdown
## References

- Source Title: https://example.com/
- Another Source: https://docs.example.com/guide
- IETF RFC 1234: https://tools.ietf.org/
```

### Key Findings
Extract 3-5 most important takeaways:

```markdown
## Key Findings

- **Finding 1**: Brief description with context
- **Finding 2**: Why this matters to the project
- **Finding 3**: Trade-offs or considerations
```

### Link to Work
Reference research from ADRs, Epics, and Stories:

```markdown
# ADR-0042: Use PostgreSQL for persistence

**Research**: See [Database Comparison](../10-research/20251220-database-comparison.md)
```
