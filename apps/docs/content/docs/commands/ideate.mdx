# /ideate

Generate improvement ideas by deploying multiple domain experts in parallel to analyze your codebase from different perspectives (security, performance, code quality, UX, testing, API/Architecture).

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ideate SCOPE=all DEPTH=quick OUTPUT=report
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SCOPE` | No | `all` | Which domains to analyze: `all`, `security`, `perf`, `code`, `ux` |
| `DEPTH` | No | `quick` | Analysis depth: `quick` (3 ideas), `deep` (5 ideas) |
| `OUTPUT` | No | `report` | Output type: `report` (ideation only), `stories` (create stories), `both` |

## Examples

### Analyze All Domains - Quick Scope

```bash
/agileflow:ideate SCOPE=all DEPTH=quick OUTPUT=report
```

Deploys 6 experts (security, performance, refactor, ui, testing, api) to generate 3 improvement ideas each. Results in ideation report with high/medium confidence ideas.

### Deep Security Analysis

```bash
/agileflow:ideate SCOPE=security DEPTH=deep OUTPUT=stories
```

Focuses on security with deep analysis (5 ideas per expert). Creates stories for high-confidence items immediately.

### Performance Analysis with Both Report and Stories

```bash
/agileflow:ideate SCOPE=perf DEPTH=deep OUTPUT=both
```

Analyzes performance with experts (performance, database, api), generates report and creates implementation stories.

## Scope Mapping

| SCOPE | Experts Deployed | Best For |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| `all` | Security, Performance, Refactor, UI, Testing, API | Comprehensive analysis (6 experts) |
| `security` | Security, API, Testing | Security review (3 experts) |
| `perf` | Performance, Database, API | Performance optimization (3 experts) |
| `code` | Refactor, Testing, API | Code quality (3 experts) |
| `ux` | UI, Accessibility, API | User experience (3 experts) |

## Output Structure

### Ideation Report (`output.md`)

The command generates `docs/08-project/ideation-<YYYYMMDD>.md` with:

1. **Summary**: Total ideas, confidence breakdown
2. **High-Confidence Improvements**: Ideas agreed by 2+ experts (prioritize these)
3. **Medium-Confidence Opportunities**: Single expert with evidence (worth exploring)
4. **Summary by Category**: Table of idea counts per domain
5. **Recommended Next Steps**: Implementation guidance

### Confidence Scoring

| Confidence | Criteria | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **HIGH** | 2+ experts suggest similar idea | Include prominently, recommend immediate action |
| **MEDIUM** | 1 expert with specific evidence (file paths, metrics) | Include as opportunity |
| **LOW** | 1 expert, vague/no evidence | Exclude from report |

### Sample Report Section

```markdown
# Ideation Report

**Generated**: 2025-12-30
**Scope**: all
**Depth**: quick
**Total Ideas**: 15 (High: 4, Medium: 8, Low: 3)

## 🎯 High-Confidence Improvements
*Agreed by multiple experts - prioritize these*

### 1. Add request rate limiting to API
**Category**: Security | **Impact**: High | **Effort**: 1-2 days
**Experts**: Security, API
**Why**: Prevents DDoS attacks and brute force attempts
**Files**: `src/api/middleware/auth.ts`, `src/api/routes/`

## 💡 Medium-Confidence Opportunities
*Single expert with evidence - worth exploring*

### 5. Implement caching layer for database queries
**Category**: Performance | **Impact**: High | **Effort**: 2-3 days
**Expert**: Performance
**Why**: Your homepage renders 200+ components, this would fix 2-second load time
**Files**: `src/db/queries.ts`, `src/cache/`
```

### Generated Stories (Optional)

When `OUTPUT=stories` or `OUTPUT=both`, creates implementation stories in `docs/06-stories/` for each high-confidence idea:

```markdown
---
story_id: US-XXXX
type: improvement
ideation_source: ideation-20251230.md
estimate: 1d
---

# US-XXXX: Idea from Ideation

## Background
Identified in ideation report. Agreed by: Security, API experts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific criterion 1
- [ ] Specific criterion 2
- [ ] Tests pass

## Technical Notes
Implementation approach from ideation analysis.
```

## How It Works

1. **Parse Arguments**: Determines which experts to deploy and analysis depth
2. **Deploy Experts in Parallel**: Launches all experts simultaneously
3. **Each Expert Generates Ideas**: 3-5 specific, actionable improvement ideas
4. **Collect Results**: Waits for all experts to complete
5. **Synthesize**: Groups overlapping ideas, scores confidence
6. **Generate Output**: Creates report (and optional stories)

## Best Practices

### Get the Most from /ideate

**Do This:**
- Use `SCOPE=all` quarterly for comprehensive analysis
- Use specific SCOPE for focused improvement areas
- Use `DEPTH=deep` when investigating specific domain
- Review HIGH-confidence ideas first
- Create stories for HIGH-confidence improvements

**Don't Do This:**
- Ignore MEDIUM-confidence ideas with specific evidence
- Try to implement everything at once
- Use without running git to get latest code context
- Skip the "why" section when deciding to implement

### Interpreting Results

**High-Confidence Ideas** (2+ experts):
- Strong signal of real improvement opportunity
- Recommended for immediate action
- Usually require 1-3 days of effort

**Medium-Confidence Ideas** (single expert):
- Valuable but less certain
- Worth discussing with team
- Often good candidates for next sprint

**Vague Ideas**:
- Automatically excluded from report
- Too generic without file paths or metrics
- If interested, do focused research first

## Integration

### With Sprint Planning

After ideation, use high-confidence items to populate sprint:

```bash
/agileflow:ideate SCOPE=all DEPTH=quick OUTPUT=stories
# Stories created → add to sprint planning with /agileflow:sprint
```

### With Retrospectives

Run ideation after retrospectives to find systemic improvements:

```bash
/agileflow:ideate SCOPE=code DEPTH=deep
# Analyze code quality problems identified in retro
```

### With ADRs

Convert architectural ideas into ADRs:

```bash
/agileflow:ideate SCOPE=architecture OUTPUT=report
# Review HIGH-confidence architectural improvements
/agileflow:adr NUMBER=0045 TITLE="..." CONTEXT="From ideation"
```
