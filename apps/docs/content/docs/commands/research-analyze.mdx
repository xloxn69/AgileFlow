description: Analyze existing research for implementation in your project
---

# /research:analyze

Revisit existing research notes and analyze how they could be implemented in your project with project-specific context.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:research:analyze FILE=20250106-caching-strategy.md
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FILE` | No | - | Filename of research note (will prompt if not provided) |

## Examples

### Analyze Specific Research

```bash
/agileflow:research:analyze FILE=20250106-nextjs-upgrade.md
```

Analyzes the Next.js upgrade research and shows how to implement it in your project.

### Interactive Selection

```bash
/agileflow:research:analyze
```

Without FILE parameter, lists available research and asks you to select one.

## Workflow

The command guides you through a structured analysis:

### Step 1: Select Research

If FILE not provided, shows recent research with descriptions:

```
Which research would you like to analyze for implementation?

- [Most recent] - Topic description
- [Second most recent] - Topic description
- Show full list - View all research notes
```

### Step 2: Review Research Summary

Displays a brief summary of the research:

```markdown
## Research: OAuth Implementation Best Practices

**Imported**: 2024-12-20
**Source**: OAuth 2.0 RFC and industry guides

### Key Findings
- Use PKCE flow for mobile/SPA applications
- Implement proper token refresh strategies
- Always use HTTPS for OAuth endpoints
```

### Step 3: Enter Plan Mode

Automatically enters plan mode and gathers your project context:

```bash
node .agileflow/scripts/obtain-context.js babysit
```

This reads your actual codebase to make the analysis project-specific.

### Step 4: Detailed Implementation Analysis

Shows how the research applies to YOUR specific project:

```markdown
## Implementation Analysis for "OAuth Implementation"

### 🎯 Benefits of Implementing This Research

**What you would gain:**
- Your current auth.ts uses basic session tokens
  This research would add OAuth support for third-party integrations
  Would reduce login friction for users with existing accounts

**Problems this solves:**
- Current authentication doesn't support federated login
- Manual credential management creates security risks
- No single sign-on capability for enterprise customers

**Why now?**
- Q1 roadmap includes enterprise customer onboarding
- Your login modal receives 50+ complaints/month about manual login

---

### 🔧 How It Would Be Implemented

**Files to modify:**
| File | Change | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src/api/auth/auth.ts` | Add OAuth strategy | Medium |
| `src/api/routes/auth.ts` | Add OAuth endpoints | Medium |
| `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` | Add OAuth button | Low |

**New files to create:**
- `src/auth/strategies/oauth-google.ts` - Google OAuth handler
- `src/auth/strategies/oauth-github.ts` - GitHub OAuth handler

**Implementation steps:**
1. Install @agileflow/oauth provider
2. Configure OAuth apps (Google, GitHub)
3. Add OAuth strategy to authentication
4. Update login form with OAuth buttons
5. Test OAuth flow end-to-end

---

### 🔄 What Would Change

**Behavior changes:**
- Login page shows "Sign in with Google/GitHub" option
- Users can authenticate with existing accounts
- Session management handles both local and federated auth

**Architecture impact:**
- New OAuth provider layer between auth and strategies
- Token management becomes more complex
- Security: Must implement PKCE and state validation

**Dependencies:**
- Install: `@agileflow/oauth` (240 KB)
- No breaking changes to existing code

---

### ⚠️ Risks & Considerations

- **Implementation complexity**: OAuth spec is complex, requires careful implementation
  *Mitigation*: Use established library, comprehensive testing

- **User adoption**: Some users may not have Google/GitHub accounts
  *Mitigation*: Keep local auth as fallback option

- **Third-party dependencies**: OAuth providers could change APIs
  *Mitigation*: Use abstraction layer, wrap provider-specific code

---

### ⏱️ Effort Estimate

**Scope**: Medium
**Suggested approach**: Epic with 4-5 stories
**Estimated effort**: 3-5 days
```

### Step 5: Decide on Implementation

Shows benefits and asks if you want to create artifacts:

```
Based on this analysis, would you like to proceed with implementation?

- Yes - Create implementation artifacts (Recommended)
- Modify approach first - Let's adjust the plan
- Save analysis to research file - For later review
- Cancel - Exit plan mode
```

### Step 6: Intelligent Artifact Recommendation

Based on research type, recommends the best artifact:

| Research Type | Recommended Artifact | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture decision (OAuth vs local auth) | **ADR** | One-time decision with trade-offs |
| Feature with 5+ steps (OAuth integration) | **Epic + Stories** | Multiple files, multiple domains |
| Single focused task (Add OAuth button) | **Story** | Clear scope, 1-3 files |
| Best practices (Error handling patterns) | **Practice doc** | Guidelines, not tracked work |

Then asks:

```
Based on scope, I recommend creating an Epic with 4-5 stories.

What would you like to do?

- Epic + Stories (Recommended)
- Create ADR instead
- Create single story instead
- Skip artifact creation
```

### Step 7: Create Artifacts

Based on your choice, creates:

- **ADR**: Documents architectural decision and trade-offs
- **Epic + Stories**: Breaks down into trackable work
- **Story**: Creates single work item
- **Nothing**: Just closes with analysis saved

## Output Files

### Analysis Saved

The detailed analysis is saved to the research file:

```
docs/10-research/20250106-oauth-strategy.md
  ├── Original research content (unchanged)
  └── ## Implementation Analysis section (appended)
```

### Artifacts Created

If you choose to create artifacts:

**If ADR:**
```
docs/03-decisions/adr-0045-oauth-authentication.md
  └── Links back to research
```

**If Epic + Stories:**
```
docs/05-epics/EP-0015.md
  └── OAuth Integration Epic

docs/06-stories/EP-0015/
  ├── US-0151-setup-oauth-providers.md
  ├── US-0152-implement-google-login.md
  ├── US-0153-implement-github-login.md
  ├── US-0154-update-login-form.md
  └── US-0155-test-oauth-flow.md

docs/09-agents/status.json
  └── All stories added with ready status
```

**If Story:**
```
docs/06-stories/<EPIC>/US-XXXX-oauth-implementation.md
```

## Key Features

### Project-Specific Analysis

Instead of generic advice:

```
❌ WRONG: "You should implement OAuth for better security"
✅ RIGHT: "Your auth.ts currently uses basic sessions.
           OAuth would add federation for the 50+ enterprise
           customers in your Q1 roadmap."
```

### Benefits First

Always shows what you GAIN before implementation complexity:

```
Benefits:
- Reduce login friction
- Support 3rd party integrations
- Enterprise-ready authentication

Then implementation details...
```

### Intelligent Recommendations

Doesn't default to Epic for everything:

```
Simple task (add button) → Story
Medium feature (OAuth setup) → Epic + Stories
Architecture decision → ADR
Guidelines → Practice doc
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use /research:analyze

**Use it when:**
- You imported research earlier and now need implementation
- You want to understand project-specific impact
- You're deciding whether to tackle this now or later
- You want to turn research into trackable work

**Don't use it when:**
- Just reading research for information (use `/research:view`)
- Not ready to implement (just review, don't create artifacts)
- Analyzing brand new research (use `/research:import` first)

### Getting Better Recommendations

Before analyzing research:
- Ensure your codebase is current (latest commit)
- Have key files organized (README, main docs)
- Understand your tech stack (documented in CLAUDE.md)

The analysis reads your actual code to make specific recommendations.

### Choosing Artifact Type

**Choose ADR if:**
- This is a one-time architectural decision
- Multiple trade-off options were evaluated
- Team needs to understand why

**Choose Epic + Stories if:**
- Feature spans 5+ implementation steps
- Multiple files and domains affected
- 3+ days of effort

**Choose Story if:**
- Single, focused implementation task
- 1-3 files affected
- Can be done in 1-2 hours

**Choose Practice doc if:**
- This is guidance/best practices
- Applies to many future tasks
- Not tracked as work
