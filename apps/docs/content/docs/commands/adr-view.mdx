# /adr:view

View full ADR details and take context-aware actions based on the ADR's current status.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:adr:view NUMBER=0042
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NUMBER` | Yes | - | ADR number (4-digit, e.g., 0042) |

## Examples

### View Specific ADR

```bash
/agileflow:adr:view NUMBER=0003
```

Displays the full content of ADR-0003 and offers context-aware actions.

### Interactive Selection

```bash
/agileflow:adr:view
```

Without NUMBER parameter, shows recent ADRs and asks you to select one.

## Output Format

Each ADR view includes:

### Header Information

```markdown
## ADR-0042: Use PostgreSQL for Persistence

**Status**: accepted
**Date**: 2024-12-28
**Tags**: database, architecture
```

### Sections

1. **Context**: Explains why this decision was needed
   - Problem or constraint that triggered the decision
   - Business drivers and technical requirements
   - Alternative options that were considered

2. **Decision**: What was chosen and why
   - Clear statement of the decision
   - Rationale for this choice over alternatives
   - Specific versions or configurations if relevant

3. **Consequences**: Trade-offs and impacts
   - **Positive**: Benefits and improvements
   - **Negative**: Costs, risks, learning curve
   - Mitigation strategies if applicable

4. **Related**: Links to research, stories, other ADRs
   - Research that led to this decision
   - Implementation stories created from this ADR
   - Other ADRs this supersedes or is superseded by

## Context-Aware Actions

Actions change based on ADR status:

### For Proposed ADRs

When an ADR is still `proposed`, you can:
- **Accept this ADR**: Mark as `accepted` and in effect
- **Request changes**: Modify the proposal
- **Reject this ADR**: Mark as `rejected` with reason

### For Accepted ADRs (Recommended)

When an ADR is `accepted`, you can:
- **Create implementation stories**: Turn decision into actionable work
- **Supersede with new ADR**: Replace with updated decision
- **Deprecate this ADR**: Mark as no longer applicable
- **View related research**: See research that led to decision

### For Deprecated ADRs

When an ADR is `deprecated`, you can:
- **View deprecation history**: See why it was deprecated
- **Reactivate this ADR**: Mark as `accepted` again if context changes
- **View replacement ADR**: See what superseded this
- **Back to ADR list**: Return to full list

### For Superseded ADRs

When an ADR is `superseded`, you can:
- **View replacement ADR**: See the ADR that replaced this one
- **View decision evolution**: Understand how this decision evolved
- **Back to ADR list**: Return to full list

## Typical Workflows

### Approve Proposed Decision

```
1. /agileflow:adr:view NUMBER=0045
   (See proposed architecture decision)
2. Select "Accept this ADR"
3. ADR status changes to accepted
4. Select "Create implementation stories"
5. Stories created in docs/06-stories/
```

### Implement Accepted Decision

```
1. /agileflow:adr:view NUMBER=0042
   (See accepted architecture decision)
2. Select "Create implementation stories"
3. Stories created for implementing this decision
4. Work on stories with /agileflow:babysit
```

### Track Decision Evolution

```
1. /agileflow:adr:view NUMBER=0010
   (Old approach)
2. See "Superseded by ADR-0035"
3. Select "View replacement ADR"
4. See how decision evolved over time
```

### Reconsider Deprecated Decision

```
1. /agileflow:adr:view NUMBER=0015
   (Deprecated approach)
2. Check why it was deprecated
3. If context changed: "Reactivate this ADR"
4. Mark as accepted again
```

## Example ADR Display

```markdown
## ADR-0042: Use PostgreSQL for Persistence

**Status**: accepted
**Date**: 2024-12-28
**Tags**: database, architecture

---

### Context

We need a reliable database with ACID guarantees for user data and transactions.
The application handles financial transactions requiring strong consistency.
Current SQLite implementation cannot scale to multiple servers.

---

### Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database because:
- Mature, well-tested ACID compliance
- Excellent tooling and ecosystem
- Team has existing experience
- Supports advanced features (JSONB, full-text search)

---

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Strong data integrity guarantees
- Better performance at scale
- Rich query capabilities
- Team familiarity reduces learning curve

**Negative:**
- Requires managed database service or self-hosting
- Team needs PostgreSQL-specific training
- Migration effort from SQLite
- Slightly higher operational complexity than NoSQL

## Best Practices

### When Reviewing an ADR

- Read Context first to understand the problem
- Review both positive and negative Consequences
- Check Related section for implementation work
- Look at decision evolution (if superseded)

### When Deciding Whether to Implement

Ask these questions:
1. Is this ADR in `accepted` status?
2. Do Positive consequences match our current needs?
3. Are we prepared for Negative consequences?
4. Do we have implementation capacity?

### When ADR Status Changes

Always use `/agileflow:adr:update` to document:
- Why the status is changing
- What triggered the change
- Reference to replacement ADR (if superseded)
