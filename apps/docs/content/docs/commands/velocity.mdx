# /velocity

Calculate team velocity from completed stories, identify trends, and forecast epic and milestone completion dates with confidence levels.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:velocity
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PERIOD` | No | sprint | Time period: `week`, `sprint`, `month`, or `all` |
| `FORECAST` | No | - | Predict completion for epic/milestone (e.g., EP-0010) |
| `FORMAT` | No | report | Output format: `report`, `chart`, or `json` |

## Examples

### View Current Velocity

```bash
/agileflow:velocity
```

Show velocity for the last sprint (2 weeks) with trends.

### Last Week Only

```bash
/agileflow:velocity PERIOD=week
```

Focus on the most recent week's velocity.

### Month-Long Trend

```bash
/agileflow:velocity PERIOD=month
```

30-day velocity trend to identify seasonal patterns.

### Forecast Epic Completion

```bash
/agileflow:velocity FORECAST=EP-0010
```

Predict when the Authentication epic will complete based on current velocity.

### View as Chart

```bash
/agileflow:velocity FORMAT=chart
```

ASCII art velocity chart for terminal viewing.

### Export as JSON

```bash
/agileflow:velocity FORMAT=json
```

Machine-readable format for integration with other tools.

## Velocity Calculation

Velocity = Total points completed per time period

**Example**:
- Week 1: 8 story-days completed
- Week 2: 10 story-days completed
- Week 3: 7 story-days completed
- **Average velocity**: (8+10+7)/3 = **8.3 story-days/week**

Points are calculated from story estimate multiplied by completion during the period.

## Velocity Report

The default report format includes multiple sections:

### Current Velocity Section

```

## Forecasting

When you specify `FORECAST=<epic>`, the command predicts completion:

### Forecast Example

```
🎯 Forecast: Epic Completion

EP-0010: User Authentication
- Stories: 12 total
- Completed: 8 (66%)
- Remaining: 4 stories, 6 points
- At current velocity (8.3 pts/wk): under 1 week
- Forecast completion: 2025-12-31 (7 days)
- Confidence: High (85%)
```

**Confidence levels**:
- **High (>80%)** - Stable velocity, reliable forecast
- **Medium (60-80%)** - Some variance, reasonable forecast
- **Low (under 60%)** - High variance, forecast unreliable

### Forecasting Algorithm

```
Days to complete = (Remaining points / Velocity) * 7
Completion date = Today + Days to complete
Confidence = 100% - (Velocity std dev / Velocity avg) * 100
```

## Velocity by Story Size

Insights into which story sizes work best:

```
Size    | Count | Avg Days | Success Rate
--------|-------|----------|-------------
≤0.5d   |   8   |   0.4d   | 100% ✅
0.5-1d  |  12   |   0.9d   |  92% ✅
1-1.5d  |  10   |   1.3d   |  80% ⚠️
1.5-2d  |   6   |   2.1d   |  67% ⚠️
>2d     |   3   |   3.5d   |  33% 🔴
```

Shows that smaller stories complete faster and more reliably.

**Insight**: Stories ≤1d complete fastest. Split stories >1.5d into smaller increments.

## Risk Analysis

The report includes risk assessment:

```
⚠️ Risk Analysis

### Velocity Risks
1. **AG-API dependency**: 50% of points from one agent
   - Mitigation: Cross-train, pair programming

2. **Story size variance**: Some 2d stories slow velocity
   - Mitigation: Split stories >1.5d

3. **Seasonal slowdown**: Historical dip in Week 5
   - Mitigation: Add buffer to forecasts

### Schedule Risks
- EP-0011 blocking release
- If velocity drops 20% → Release delayed 1 week
- If AG-API unavailable → 50% velocity loss
```

Helps identify and mitigate risks to forecasts.

## Capacity Planning

Recommendations for sprint planning:

```
📅 Capacity Planning

**Current Capacity**: 8.3 points/week (4 agents)

**This Sprint** (2 weeks):
- Plan: 16-18 points (2x velocity)
- Buffer: Keep 2-3 ready stories
- Focus: Complete EP-0010

**Next Sprint**:
- Plan: 16-20 points
- Priority: EP-0011 (release blocker)
- Consider: Add stories for AG-CI (underutilized)

**Long-term**:
- Maintain 8-10 points/week sustained velocity
- Reserve 20% for tech debt
- Keep story sizes ≤1.5d for predictability
```

Helps plan sprint workload based on actual velocity.

  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Track over 3+ periods** - Need at least 3 weeks for reliable velocity
2. **Use consistent estimates** - Estimates in same units (days, points)
3. **Review trends** - Look for improving or declining patterns
4. **Account for holidays** - Adjust forecasts for time off
5. **Update weekly** - Track velocity each sprint for trends

## Velocity Goals

Set team targets and track progress:

```
🎯 Velocity Goals

Current:    8.3 points/week
Target:     10 points/week (by end of quarter)
Stretch:    12 points/week

Action Items:
- [ ] Split 2 large stories (US-0050, US-0051)
- [ ] Assign 2 more stories to AG-CI
- [ ] Review blockers (US-0041)
- [ ] Celebrate hitting 10 pts/wk! 🎉
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why is my velocity so variable?**
A: Possible causes:
- Stories too varied in size (standardize estimates)
- Frequent interruptions (protect work time)
- Blockers slowing completion (unblock faster)
- Team capacity changes (new members, absences)

**Q: How many data points do I need?**
A: At least 3 time periods for reliability. Less than 5 periods = low confidence forecast.

**Q: Should I include velocity during onboarding?**
A: No, exclude first sprints. New team members lower velocity temporarily.

**Q: What if velocity is declining?**
A: Investigate:
- Increasing blockers?
- Larger stories?
- Team absences?
- Quality issues requiring rework?

**Q: Can I forecast with low confidence?**
A: Yes, but use wide buffers. P90 estimate (90% confidence) is more conservative than P50 (50% confidence).
