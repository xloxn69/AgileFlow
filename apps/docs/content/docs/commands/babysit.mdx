# /babysit

An interactive mentor that guides you through implementing features from plain-English requirements to completed pull requests. Babysit combines automated context gathering, intelligent task suggestions, and hands-on code assistance.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:babysit
```

The command will:
1. Gather all project context (stories, epics, tests, documentation)
2. Present intelligent task suggestions based on priority and readiness
3. Guide you through implementation step-by-step
4. Update your project status as you work
5. Generate PR descriptions when ready

## Key Features

### Intelligent Task Suggestions

When you start `/babysit`, it analyzes your project and recommends:

- **READY stories** (all AC complete, tests stubbed) - Highest priority
- **Blocked stories** (with clear unblock paths) - High priority
- **Near-complete epics** (80%+ stories done) - Finish what you started
- **Roadmap priorities** - Important strategic work
- **Research gaps** - Prep work to avoid debugging later

Tasks are ranked by what a real developer would prioritize, not just by recency or order.

### Hands-On Implementation Guidance

For each story or feature:

```
1. Validate story readiness (acceptance criteria, tests)
2. Read architecture context relevant to the task
3. Plan implementation in small steps
4. Apply code changes incrementally with diffs
5. Run tests after each change
6. Update project status as you progress
7. Generate PR description when complete
```

### Agent Expert Spawning

For complex work, babysit automatically detects the domain and spawns specialists:

- **Database work** → AG-DATABASE expert
- **API endpoints** → AG-API expert
- **UI components** → AG-UI expert
- **Testing** → AG-TESTING expert
- **Documentation** → AG-DOCUMENTATION expert

Specialists handle focused deep work while babysit coordinates overall flow.

### Progress Tracking

All work is tracked with a todo list:

```
1. Run context script (loads all project state)
2. Present task suggestions
3. Read task-specific documentation
4. Validate story readiness
5. Plan implementation steps
6. Apply code changes with tests
7. Update project status
8. Generate PR description
9. Mark complete
```

You can see exactly where you are and what's left.

## Usage

### Basic - Let babysit suggest work

```bash
/agileflow:babysit
```

Babysit will analyze your project and ask what you'd like to work on.

### Resume existing work

```bash
/agileflow:babysit
```

If you have stories in `in_progress` status, babysit will offer to resume them.

### Work on specific story

You can tell babysit "I want to work on US-0042" and it will:
- Load the story file
- Validate it's ready
- Plan the implementation
- Guide you through building it

## Parameters

Babysit accepts free-form natural language input:

| Input | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `"Add user profile page"` | Create new feature or find matching story |
| `"US-0042"` | Work on specific story |
| `"Continue"` | Resume the last story you were working on |
| `"What should I work on?"` | Get recommendations (default) |

## Examples

### Start fresh implementation

```bash
/agileflow:babysit
# Babysit suggests: "US-0042: User Login API is READY"
# You confirm → Implementation begins
# Babysit guides through: Plan → Code → Test → PR
```

### Complete multiple related stories

```bash
/agileflow:babysit
# Babysit shows: "EP-0005 is 80% done. 1 story left: US-0051"
# You accept → Start final story
# Babysit tracks progress
# When done → Ready for baseline or release
```

### Unknown requirements

```bash
/agileflow:babysit
# You: "I want user authentication but not sure the best way"
# Babysit: "Should I research JWT vs sessions first? This prevents debugging later"
# You: "Yes, research"
# Babysit: Runs /context MODE=research, saves findings, then plans implementation
```

## Workflow Overview

```
Start → Gather Context → Suggest Tasks → Choose Task
  ↓
Read Story & Architecture → Validate Readiness → Plan Steps
  ↓
Implement Code → Run Tests → Update Status
  ↓
Generate PR → Finish
```

## Definition of Ready

Before implementing, babysit checks that stories have:

- ✓ Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then format)
- ✓ Architecture Context with source citations
- ✓ Test stubs in docs/07-testing/
- ✓ Dependencies resolved and documented
- ✓ Previous insights from related stories

If any are missing, babysit will suggest completing them first (stories stay "draft" until ready).

## Context Loading

When you start babysit, it runs this context script automatically:

```bash
node .agileflow/scripts/obtain-context.js babysit
```

This single command gathers:
- Git status, branch, uncommitted changes
- All stories and epics from status.json
- Session state and active sessions
- Documentation structure
- Research notes (newest first)
- Recent agent messages
- Key file presence

One script call, comprehensive context, fast startup.

## When to Use

### Best For

- **Starting implementation** - Need guidance on what to work on
- **Picking up mid-feature** - Resume from where you left off
- **Epic completion** - Finish final stories in a feature set
- **Uncertain requirements** - Research questions before coding
- **Multi-step features** - Complex work across files
- **Testing validation** - Ensure tests pass before PR

### Not For

- **Quick fixes** (typos, one-liners) - Just do them yourself
- **Pure research** - Use `/agileflow:context MODE=research` instead
- **Architectural decisions** - Use `/agileflow:adr` instead
- **Documentation only** - Use `/agileflow:docs` instead

## Output Style

Babysit uses clear, actionable output:

- **Headings** for major sections
- **Short bullets** for options and explanations
- **Code blocks** for diffs and examples
- **Questions** to guide your decisions (never asks you to "type")
- **Progress updates** as you work

Every response ends with a next-step question so you're always in control.

## Integration with Other Commands

Babysit works alongside other AgileFlow commands:

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Need to verify tests? | `/agileflow:verify` |
| Need PR description? | `/agileflow:pr` |
| Need code review? | `/agileflow:review` |
| Want to research first? | `/agileflow:context MODE=research` |
| Need impact analysis? | `/agileflow:impact` |
| Ready for baseline? | `/agileflow:baseline` |

## Tips

### Get better suggestions

- Keep your story backlog in status.json
- Write clear acceptance criteria
- Mark stories as ready when complete
- Keep architecture docs current

### Successful implementations

- Let babysit validate story readiness first
- Read the architecture context section
- Implement in small steps (not all at once)
- Run tests after each change
- Ask for help if stuck

### Multi-expert orchestration

For complex features, babysit will automatically:
- Spawn API expert for backend work
- Spawn UI expert for frontend work
- Run both in parallel if independent
- Coordinate the final integration

You don't need to manually manage multiple agents - babysit handles it.

## Common Patterns

### "I don't know what to work on"

```
/agileflow:babysit
→ Babysit shows ranked suggestions
→ Pick the one that interests you
→ Let babysit guide the implementation
```

### "I want to finish this epic"

```
/agileflow:babysit
→ "EP-0005 is 80% done, 2 stories left"
→ Choose story
→ Complete it with babysit's guidance
→ Move to next story
→ When done: /agileflow:baseline "EP-0005 complete"
```

### "I need to research this first"

```
/agileflow:babysit
→ "Need to understand JWT patterns first?"
→ "Yes, research"
→ /agileflow:context MODE=research TOPIC="JWT best practices"
→ Copy research results back
→ Babysit plans implementation based on research
→ Code with confidence
```
