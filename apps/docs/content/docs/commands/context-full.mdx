# /agileflow:context:full

Generate or refresh the comprehensive context brief for web AI tools.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:context:full
```

## Purpose

Creates or updates `docs/context.md` with managed sections containing:

- What we're building and current focus
- Feature map and tech/tooling summary
- Key decisions (ADRs) and architecture snapshot
- Testing & CI status
- Recent progress (last 10 bus messages)
- Risks and next steps

This file is designed to be pasted into ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Claude web to give external AI tools full project context.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Gather Sources

The command reads information from multiple project files:

| Source | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `docs/09-agents/status.json` | Current story/epic status |
| `docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl` | Last 10 progress messages |
| `docs/05-epics/*.md` | Epic details |
| `docs/06-stories/*/*.md` | Story details |
| `docs/03-decisions/*.md` | Architecture Decision Records |
| `docs/02-practices/*.md` | Development practices |
| `docs/04-architecture/*.md` | System architecture |
| `package.json` | Project manifest and dependencies |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | CI configuration |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Recent changes |

### Step 2: Generate Managed Sections

The command creates or updates these sections:

```markdown
<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: overview -->
## What We're Building
[Project description from package.json or README]

## Current Focus
[Active epics/stories from status.json]
<!-- END_MANAGED -->

<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: features -->
## Feature Map
| Epic | Status | Stories |
|------|--------|---------|
[One line per epic]
<!-- END_MANAGED -->

<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: tech -->
## Tech Stack
- Framework: [from package.json]
- Key dependencies: [list major deps]
- Testing: [from scripts or CI]
<!-- END_MANAGED -->

<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: decisions -->
## Key Decisions (ADRs)
[List of ADRs with titles and status]
<!-- END_MANAGED -->

<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: progress -->
## Recent Progress
[Last 10 entries from bus/log.jsonl]
<!-- END_MANAGED -->

<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: next -->
## Next Steps
[Stories in READY status]
<!-- END_MANAGED -->
```

### Step 3: Diff-First Confirmation

Before writing changes, the command shows a diff and asks for confirmation:

```diff
- [old content]
+ [new content]
```

Changes are only applied after you confirm.

## Section Limits

To keep the context brief readable:

| Section | Max Lines |
|---------|-----------|
| overview | 10 |
| features | 20 |
| tech | 15 |
| decisions | 15 |
| progress | 30 |
| next | 20 |

## Managed vs User Content

The command distinguishes between:

**Managed sections** (between markers):
```markdown
<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: overview -->
[Content here - OK to update]
<!-- END_MANAGED -->
```

**User-written sections** (no markers):
```markdown
## My Custom Section
[Content here - NEVER touched]
```

User content outside managed markers is always preserved.

## Missing Files

If source files don't exist, the command adapts gracefully:

| Missing File | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| `docs/context.md` | Create new file with all sections |
| `status.json` | Skip features/next sections, use placeholders |
| `bus/log.jsonl` | Skip progress section |
| ADR files | Skip decisions section |
| CI config | Skip CI details from tech section |

## Example Output

```markdown
# Project Context Brief

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-24
**Project**: AgileFlow - AI-powered project management

<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: overview -->
## What We're Building

AgileFlow is a comprehensive project management system powered by AI agents...

## Current Focus

- EP-0010: Documentation System (in_progress)
- US-0042: Add Loop Mode docs (in_progress)
<!-- END_MANAGED -->

<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: features -->
## Feature Map

| Epic | Status | Stories |
|------|--------|---------|
| EP-0010 | in_progress | 5 total, 3 done |
| EP-0009 | complete | 7 total, 7 done |
<!-- END_MANAGED -->

```

## When to Use

- **After major milestones** - Capture completed work
- **Before web AI sessions** - Ensure context is current
- **After architecture changes** - Record new decisions
- **During sprint planning** - Update focus areas

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate or refresh context
/agileflow:context:full

# 2. Export for web AI (read-only)
/agileflow:context:export

# 3. Copy and paste into ChatGPT/Perplexity/Gemini
```
