```
4/6 (67%) = 4 stories done, 2 remaining, 67% complete
```

- 0-25%: Epic just started
- 25-50%: Ramping up, mid-sprint
- 50-75%: Most work identified
- 75-100%: Final push to completion

### When to Add More Stories

Consider adding stories if:
- Progress is plateauing (stuck at same percentage)
- Team is blocked waiting for dependencies
- New requirements emerged

### When to Close Epic

Close when:
- All stories are marked as `done`
- Acceptance criteria are met
- Ready to move to next epic
