# /agileflow:research:ask

Generate a comprehensive, context-rich research prompt for external AI tools when you need expert help.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="your research topic"
```

Example for troubleshooting:

```bash
/agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="next-auth Google OAuth" ERROR="[auth][error] CallbackRouteError: unauthorized_client"
```

## Purpose

When you're stuck on a problem or need expert guidance, this command generates a **detailed 200+ line prompt** that includes:

- Your current codebase context and code snippets
- Exact error messages and stack traces
- What you've already tried
- Specific questions to answer

The generated prompt is designed to get actionable, specific answers from AI tools.

## Parameters

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| TOPIC | Yes | What you're researching (e.g., "OAuth 2.0 with Google") |
| DETAILS | No | Constraints, deadlines, or specific requirements |
| ERROR | No | Exact error message if troubleshooting |

## What Gets Generated

The command creates a structured prompt with these sections:

### 1. Project Context
Framework version, dependencies, and relevant files from your codebase.

### 2. Current Implementation
**50+ lines of actual code** from your project—not pseudo-code or summaries.

### 3. The Problem
- Exact error messages (verbatim)
- Full stack trace if available
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce

### 4. What We've Already Tried
At least **2 approaches** with detailed results and analysis of why they didn't work.

### 5. Specific Questions
**3+ targeted questions** that are answerable and specific to your situation.

### 6. What I Need
- Root cause analysis
- Step-by-step solution
- Complete code examples
- Gotchas and edge cases
- Testing approach

### 7. Environment Details
Node.js version, OS, and relevant tool versions.

## Quality Requirements

The command validates the generated prompt before outputting:

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Length | ≥200 lines |
| Code snippets | ≥50 lines of actual code |
| Error details | Verbatim message if troubleshooting |
| Tried section | ≥2 approaches documented |
| Questions | ≥3 specific questions |

If any check fails, the command gathers more context and regenerates.

## Workflow

```
Step 1: Run the command
/agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="..." ERROR="..."

Step 2: Copy the generated prompt

Step 3: Paste into ChatGPT, Claude web, Perplexity, or Gemini

Step 4: Get expert analysis

Step 5: Import results back
/agileflow:research:import TOPIC="..."
(paste the response when prompted)

Step 6: Results saved to docs/10-research/
```

## Example Output

A good prompt looks like this (abbreviated):

```markdown
# Research Request: next-auth Google OAuth unauthorized_client Error

## Project Context

**Framework**: Next.js 14.0.4 with App Router
**Key Dependencies**:
- next-auth: 5.0.0-beta.4
- next: 14.0.4
- typescript: 5.3.3

---

## Current Implementation

### File: src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts

```typescript
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google";

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Google({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!,
    }),
  ],
  // ... 40+ more lines of actual code
});
```

---

## The Problem

### Error Message
```
[auth][error] CallbackRouteError: Read more at https://errors.authjs.dev#callbackrouteerror
[auth][cause]: Error: unauthorized_client
```

### Expected Behavior
User should be redirected to Google login, authenticate, and return to the app.

### Actual Behavior
After clicking "Sign in with Google", immediately get unauthorized_client error.

---

## What We've Already Tried

### Attempt 1: Verify credentials
**What we did**: Double-checked GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
**Result**: Credentials match exactly
**Why it didn't work**: Issue persists

### Attempt 2: Check redirect URIs
**What we did**: Added localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google to Google Console
**Result**: Still getting unauthorized_client

---

## Specific Questions

1. **Why does next-auth 5.0.0-beta.4 throw unauthorized_client when credentials are verified?**
2. **Is there additional configuration needed for Google OAuth with App Router?**
3. **What's the correct redirect URI format for next-auth v5?**
4. **Are there known issues with next-auth 5.0.0-beta.4 and the Google provider?**

---

## What I Need

1. **Root cause analysis**: Why is this happening?
2. **Step-by-step solution** with exact code changes
3. **Complete code examples** that I can copy-paste
4. **Gotchas and edge cases** to watch for
5. **Testing approach** to verify the fix works
```

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't generate short, vague prompts:**

```
❌ "How do I fix OAuth in Next.js?"
❌ "Getting an error with authentication, how to fix?"
❌ "Help with Google login"
```

**Always generate detailed prompts with:**

```
✅ 200+ lines with full context
✅ Actual code from your codebase
✅ Exact error messages
✅ What you've already tried
✅ Specific questions
```

## Integration with babysit

When [`/agileflow:babysit`](/commands/babysit) detects you're stuck on a problem, it suggests:

```
⚠️ You're working on this for a while. Need help?

Try:
  /agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="describe your problem"
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific with TOPIC** - Include framework versions and error types
2. **Include ERROR messages** - Full stack traces help tremendously
3. **Let the command read your code** - It extracts actual implementation
4. **Don't skip validation** - The checks ensure quality responses
