# /epic

Create a new epic with optional child stories to organize related user stories around a larger feature or goal.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:epic EPIC=<EP-ID> TITLE=<text> OWNER=<id> GOAL=<text>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `EPIC` | Yes | - | Epic identifier (e.g., EP-0001) |
| `TITLE` | Yes | - | Epic title describing the feature or goal |
| `OWNER` | Yes | - | Owner name or agent ID (e.g., AG-UI, AG-API) |
| `GOAL` | Yes | - | Outcome or metric that defines success for this epic |
| `STORIES` | No | - | Comma-separated list of initial stories (format: `US-ID\|title\|owner`) |

## Examples

### Basic Epic Creation

```bash
/agileflow:epic EPIC=EP-0010 TITLE="User Authentication" OWNER=AG-API GOAL="Enable users to securely register and log in"
```

Creates a new epic file at `docs/05-epics/EP-0010.md` with the provided details and registers it in `docs/09-agents/status.json`.

### Epic with Initial Stories

```bash
/agileflow:epic EPIC=EP-0011 TITLE="Payment Processing" OWNER=AG-API GOAL="Enable payments via Stripe" STORIES="US-0040|Stripe integration|AG-API,US-0041|Payment form|AG-UI,US-0042|Webhook handler|AG-API"
```

Creates the epic and automatically generates initial child stories under `docs/06-stories/EP-0011/`. Each story is created with:
- Status: `ready` (ready for development)
- Estimate: `0.5d` (default, can be modified)
- Dependencies: empty (updated manually as needed)

## Output

The command creates:

1. **Epic file** (`docs/05-epics/EP-XXXX.md`)
   - Epic metadata (title, owner, status, goal)
   - Current status and metrics
   - Child stories list

2. **Story files** (one per story, `docs/06-stories/EP-XXXX/US-XXXX-<slug>.md`)
   - Story template with acceptance criteria placeholders
   - Linked to parent epic
   - Ready for detailed definition

3. **Status tracking** (`docs/09-agents/status.json`)
   - Epic entry with owner and current status
   - Story entries linked to epic

4. **Agent communication** (`docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl`)
   - Assignment messages showing epic created and stories assigned

## Workflow

1. **Plan your epic** - Define the feature goal and success metrics
2. **Create the epic** - Run `/epic` command with basic details
3. **Add stories** - Either create them now with STORIES parameter or use `/story` to add individually later
4. **Develop stories** - Use `/story-validate` to ensure each story is ready before development
5. **Sprint plan** - Use `/sprint` to select stories for upcoming sprint
6. **Track progress** - Use `/board` to monitor epic completion

## Integration with Other Commands

- **After epic creation**: Use `/story` to add more stories
- **Before sprint planning**: Use `/sprint` to select stories from this epic
- **For progress tracking**: Use `/board` or `/metrics` to see epic completion
- **For dependencies**: Use `/deps` to visualize story dependencies within epic

## Best Practices

- **Keep epics focused** - One feature or feature area per epic
- **Make goals measurable** - Use specific outcomes or metrics (not "improve user experience")
- **Add stories incrementally** - Start with core stories, add related ones over time
- **Assign appropriate owners** - Match epic owner with primary development agent
- **Document context** - Add technical context in epic file after creation
