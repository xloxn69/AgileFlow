# /assign

Assign or reassign a story to an owner with optional status update. Updates story metadata and broadcasts the assignment via the message bus.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0001 NEW_OWNER=AG-UI
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `STORY` | Yes | - | Story ID to assign (e.g., US-0001, US-0042) |
| `NEW_OWNER` | Yes | - | Agent/owner ID (e.g., AG-UI, AG-API, AG-CI) |
| `NEW_STATUS` | No | - | Update status: `ready`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `in-review`, `done` |
| `NOTE` | No | - | Optional context about the assignment |

## Examples

### Assign Story to Owner

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0042 NEW_OWNER=AG-UI
```

Assign the story to the UI team without changing status.

### Assign and Start Work

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0042 NEW_OWNER=AG-UI NEW_STATUS=in-progress NOTE="Starting login form implementation"
```

Assign story and immediately mark as in progress with context.

### Reassign to Different Owner

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0038 NEW_OWNER=AG-API NEW_STATUS=ready NOTE="Re-prioritized for OAuth implementation"
```

Move story from one agent to another.

### Assign from Unassigned

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0050 NEW_OWNER=AG-CI NEW_STATUS=ready NOTE="Ready for CI/CD integration work"
```

Give work to an unassigned story.

### Reassign Due to Blocker

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0055 NEW_OWNER=AG-DEVOPS NEW_STATUS=blocked NOTE="Blocked on infrastructure provisioning. Needs DevOps attention"
```

Reassign when different expertise needed.

## What Gets Updated

The command updates two files:

### 1. Story File

Updates story frontmatter (in `docs/06-stories/**/<STORY>.md`):

```yaml
---
owner: AG-UI
status: in-progress
updated: 2025-12-24T14:30:00Z
---
```

### 2. Status Tracking File

Updates `docs/09-agents/status.json` with assignment and status change.

### 3. Message Bus

Appends an "assign" event to `docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl`:

```json
{"ts":"2025-12-24T14:30:00Z","from":"claude","type":"assign","story":"US-0042","owner":"AG-UI","status":"in-progress","text":"Starting login form implementation"}
```

## Status Values

When using `NEW_STATUS`, choose from:

| Status | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `ready` | Prepared, waiting to start | After creation or when unblocked |
| `in-progress` | Currently being worked on | When owner begins work |
| `blocked` | Waiting on external dependency | When blocker identified |
| `in-review` | Complete, awaiting approval | Code review or QA |
| `done` | Finished and verified | After all checks pass |

## Assignment Flow Example

Typical workflow through assignment states:

**1. Story created** (STORY=US-0042, OWNER=unassigned, STATUS=ready)

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0042 NEW_OWNER=AG-UI NEW_STATUS=ready
```

**2. Owner starts work**

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0042 NEW_OWNER=AG-UI NEW_STATUS=in-progress
```

**3. Code complete, ready for review**

```bash
/agileflow:status STORY=US-0042 STATUS=in-review PR=https://github.com/...
```

**4. Review complete**

```bash
/agileflow:status STORY=US-0042 STATUS=done
```

**5. If blocked during work**

```bash
/agileflow:status STORY=US-0042 STATUS=blocked SUMMARY="Blocked on API response format"
```

**6. Unblocked, resume work**

```bash
/agileflow:status STORY=US-0042 STATUS=in-progress SUMMARY="API clarified, resuming development"
```

## Output

The command displays:

1. **Diff Preview** - Shows changes to be made
2. **Confirmation** - YES/NO prompt to confirm
3. **Success Message** - Confirms assignment completed

Example output:

```text
✅ Story Assigned
Story:     US-0042
Owner:     unassigned → AG-UI
Status:    ready (unchanged)
Updated:   2025-12-24T14:30:00Z

Message broadcast: Assigned US-0042 to AG-UI
```

## JSON Safety

The command uses safe JSON handling:

- **Never uses echo/cat** - Always uses jq or Edit tool
- **Validates after update** - Checks JSON is valid before finishing
- **Backs up on error** - Can restore from backup if corruption occurs

## Best Practices

1. **Assign immediately** - Don't leave stories unassigned
2. **Include context** - Use NOTE to explain why assignment happened
3. **Match expertise** - Assign to agent with relevant skills
4. **Balance load** - Distribute work fairly across agents
5. **Update status** - Consider updating status when assigning
6. **Communicate** - Team should understand why reassignment happened

## Common Scenarios

### Load Balancing

Distribute work when one agent is overloaded:

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0055 NEW_OWNER=AG-DEVOPS NOTE="Load balancing: AG-API at WIP limit"
```

### Cross-Training

Assign to less experienced agent with guidance:

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0060 NEW_OWNER=AG-CI NEW_STATUS=ready NOTE="Cross-training opportunity for CI/CD work. Pair with AG-API"
```

### Expertise Transfer

Reassign to specialist when expertise needed:

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0065 NEW_OWNER=AG-SECURITY NEW_STATUS=in-progress NOTE="Security vulnerability fix - needs security expertise"
```

### Recovery from Blocker

Resume work after unblock:

```bash
/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0070 NEW_OWNER=AG-UI NEW_STATUS=in-progress NOTE="Unblocked: API endpoint now available, resuming frontend work"
```

  <AccordionItem value="wip">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I assign to someone who's already at WIP limit?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes, but it's not recommended. Check `/agileflow:board` to see who has capacity.

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="wrong">
    <AccordionTrigger>What if I assign wrong owner?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Simply reassign: `/agileflow:assign STORY=US-0042 NEW_OWNER=AG-API`
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="immediately">
    <AccordionTrigger>Should I assign immediately upon creation?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Best practice is yes - assign within the creation command or right after with `/assign`.

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="multiple">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I assign to multiple owners?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      No, one story = one owner. For pair programming, assign to primary and note pairing in description.

  <AccordionItem value="difference">
    <AccordionTrigger>What's the difference between assign and status?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      **assign** changes owner AND optionally status. **status** changes status only, owner unchanged. Use **assign** when changing ownership, **status** when just updating progress.
