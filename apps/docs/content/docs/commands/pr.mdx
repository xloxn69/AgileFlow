# /pr

Generate complete, ready-to-paste pull request descriptions directly from your user stories and test evidence. The PR command ensures your pull requests are well-documented, link to relevant work, and include all necessary details for reviewers.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate PR from story with title
/agileflow:pr STORY=US-0042 TITLE="Add user profile"

# Generate PR with test evidence
/agileflow:pr STORY=US-0042 TITLE="Add user profile" TEST_EVIDENCE="All unit tests pass, E2E tested login→profile flow"
```

The command will:
1. Load the story from `docs/06-stories/US-0042.md`
2. Extract acceptance criteria, dependencies, and context
3. Build a complete PR description with all sections
4. Output paste-ready markdown for GitHub/GitLab
5. Suggest a conventional commit message for squash merges

## Key Features

### Automatic Story Context

PR description automatically includes:

- **Epic reference** - Which feature this belongs to
- **Story summary** - What was implemented
- **Dependencies** - Other stories this depends on
- **Acceptance criteria** - All AC with checkbox states
- **Test evidence** - Your test results and verification
- **Risk assessment** - Potential impacts and rollback plan
- **Code owners** - From CODEOWNERS file

### Checklist Management

Acceptance criteria become a PR checklist:

```markdown
## Checklist

- [x] AC1: User can login with email and password
- [x] AC2: Login errors show validation feedback
- [ ] AC3: 2FA support (scope creep - skipped)
- [x] AC4: Session persists across page reloads
```

### Test Evidence Integration

Include test results and verification directly:

```markdown
## Test Evidence

### Unit Tests
- ✅ 42 tests passing, 0 failing
- Coverage: 87% (auth module)

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Login flow end-to-end verified
- ✅ Session persistence confirmed
- ✅ Tested with Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Tested on desktop and mobile
- ✅ Accessibility check passed (WCAG AA)
```

### Conventional Commits

Suggests proper commit messages for squash merges:

### Test Evidence

[Formatted TEST_EVIDENCE input or auto-detected from test run]

### Screenshots/GIFs

[Placeholder for visual evidence if needed]
- Login page
- Success flow
- Error handling

### Risk Assessment

**Potential Impact**:
- Changes authentication flow (affects all users)
- Modifies session handling (potential breakage in existing integrations)

**Rollback Plan**:
- Simple revert to previous commit (no database migrations)
- Sessions will remain valid for 24 hours after rollback
- Users may need to log back in if cache cleared

1. Complete implementation and testing
2. Run /agileflow:pr to generate description
3. Review the output
4. Create PR on GitHub/GitLab
5. Paste the generated description
6. Submit PR
```

### Include comprehensive test evidence

Better test evidence = faster review:

```
TEST_EVIDENCE="

- Integration Tests: Login flow, session management
- E2E: Desktop and mobile browsers
- Coverage: 89%
- Manual: Accessibility audit, performance check
"
```

- Shows testing strategy
- Documents risk decisions

## Integration with Other Commands

| Command | Integration |
|---------|-------------|
| `/babysit` | Babysit generates PR at end of implementation |
| `/review` | Run review before PR to catch issues |
| `/impact` | Include impact analysis notes |
| `/verify` | Include test results in test evidence section |
| `/baseline` | PR marks feature ready for baseline/release |

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Work on story with babysit
/agileflow:babysit
# → Choose US-0042
# → Implement with guidance
# → Tests passing

# 2. Verify tests before PR
/agileflow:verify US-0042
# → Confirms: test_status: passing

# 3. Generate PR description
/agileflow:pr STORY=US-0042 TITLE="User authentication" TEST_EVIDENCE="42/42 tests passing, E2E verified"
# → Copy output

# 4. Review code quality
/agileflow:review
# → Fix any issues

# 5. Submit PR with generated description
# → Paste PR output to GitHub
# → Submit for review

# 6. After merge, mark as done
# → Update status.json: status=completed
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Story not found"

**Error**: Story file does not exist

**Fix**: Verify story ID is correct:
```bash
/agileflow:pr STORY=US-0042 TITLE="..."
# Check that docs/06-stories/US-0042.md exists
```

### "Acceptance criteria formatting issue"

**Fix**: Ensure AC_CHECKED format matches AC count:
```bash
# BAD - Wrong number of items
AC_CHECKED="✓ AC1, ✓ AC2"

# GOOD - One per AC in story
AC_CHECKED="✓ AC1, ✓ AC2, ✓ AC3, ✗ AC4"
```

### "Test evidence too long"

**Fix**: Summarize test evidence:
```bash
# Instead of full test output, provide summary
TEST_EVIDENCE="
- Unit tests: 45/45 passing
- Integration: Login flow verified
- E2E: Chrome, Firefox tested
- Coverage: 89%
"
```
