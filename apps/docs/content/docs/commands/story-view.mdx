## Context-Aware Actions

Actions change based on story status:

### For Ready Stories

When a story is `ready` to start:

```
This story is ready to start. What would you like to do?
```

Options:
- **Start working on this story** (Recommended): Mark as in_progress
- **Validate story first**: Check if AC and dependencies are complete
- **View related research**: Find research notes for this epic
- **Back to story list**: Return to /agileflow:story:list

### For In-Progress Stories

When you're actively working on a story:

```
This story is in progress. What would you like to do?
```

Options:
- **Mark as complete**: All AC done, move to done status
- **Mark as blocked**: Hit a blocker, need help
- **View/run tests**: Check test status for this story
- **Add progress note**: Document current progress

### For Blocked Stories

When a story is blocked:

```
This story is blocked. What would you like to do?
```

Options:
- **View blocker details**: See what's blocking this story
- **Unblock and resume**: Blocker resolved, continue work
- **Reassign story**: Assign to different owner
- **Create research task**: Need to research the blocker

### For Completed Stories

When a story is done:

```
This story is complete. What would you like to do?
```

Options:
- **View completion summary**: See what was delivered
- **Reopen story**: Found issue, needs more work
- **View next story in epic**: Continue with related work
- **Back to story list**: Return to /agileflow:story:list

## Typical Workflows

### Start Implementation

```
1. /agileflow:story:view STORY=US-0042
2. Review acceptance criteria
3. Check dependencies (all done?)
4. Select "Start working on this story"
5. Story marked as in_progress
6. Begin implementation with /agileflow:babysit
```

### Continue Work

```
1. /agileflow:story:view STORY=US-0042
   (Story is in_progress)
2. See current progress notes
3. Review tests needing completion
4. Continue implementation
5. When done: Select "Mark as complete"
```

### Handle Blocker

```
1. /agileflow:story:view STORY=US-0042
   (Blocked)
2. See blocker details
3. Create task to resolve (e.g., waiting for API)
4. When resolved: Select "Unblock and resume"
5. Continue work
```

### Reopen Story

```
1. /agileflow:story:view STORY=US-0042
   (Story is done)
2. In testing, found issue
3. Select "Reopen story"
4. Story changed back to in_progress
5. Fix the issue
6. Mark as complete again
```

## Understanding Story Dependencies

The Dependencies section shows:

- ✅ **done**: Dependency complete, can proceed
- ⏳ **in_progress**: Dependency being worked on, check with owner
- 🔶 **ready**: Dependency ready to start, may want to wait
- 🚫 **blocked**: Dependency is blocked, can't proceed

**Rule**: Don't start a story if its dependencies are blocked.

## Test Status Interpretation

### Passing Tests ✅

```
Unit: LoginForm.test.tsx | passing
```

Tests pass - feature is working correctly.

### Pending Tests ⏳

```
Integration: auth-flow.test.ts | pending
```

Tests exist but haven't been run yet. Run with `/agileflow:verify`.

### Missing Tests 🔴

```
E2E: login.spec.ts | not created
```

Tests need to be created. Add them during implementation.

## Best Practices

### Before Starting Work

- [ ] Read all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are done
- [ ] Check if there's related research
- [ ] Review progress notes from planning

### During Work

- [ ] Write/update tests as you code
- [ ] Add progress notes periodically
- [ ] Mark as blocked if you hit issues
- [ ] Update AC checkboxes as you complete them

### When Complete

- [ ] All AC are checked
- [ ] All new tests pass
- [ ] Updated existing tests if needed
- [ ] Consider creating next story if epic continues
