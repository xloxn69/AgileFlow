# /multi-expert

Deploy multiple Agent Experts on the same problem or question. Each expert analyzes independently from their domain perspective, then results are synthesized for higher confidence answers.

## When to Use

Deploy multiple experts for:
- **Complex cross-domain questions** - "How does user authentication flow from login to API?"
- **Architecture analysis** - "What are the security implications of this change?"
- **Code review with multiple perspectives** - "Review this PR from different angles"
- **Debugging hard problems** - "Why is this test flaky?"
- **Best practice validation** - "Is our approach correct for this use case?"

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:multi-expert "How does user authentication flow from login to API?"
```

## How It Works

```

## Examples

### Authentication Security Review

```bash
/agileflow:multi-expert "Is our authentication implementation secure? Review JWT token handling, password storage, session management, and access control."
```

Deploys experts in:
- **Security** - JWT expiration, token validation, vulnerability analysis
- **API** - Implementation review, middleware consistency
- **Testing** - Test coverage analysis
- **Database** - Credential storage and encryption

Results in high-confidence security assessment with specific fixes.

### Complex Feature Architecture

```bash
/agileflow:multi-expert "We're building a real-time notification system. What are the architectural and performance implications?"
```

Deploys experts in:
- **Architecture** - System design patterns
- **Performance** - Latency and scalability concerns
- **Testing** - How to test distributed systems
- **DevOps** - Infrastructure requirements
