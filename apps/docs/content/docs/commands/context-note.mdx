# /agileflow:context:note

Append a timestamped note to the project context file.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Your note here"
```

## Purpose

Quickly add a note to `docs/context.md` under the "Notes" section. Useful for recording:

- Decisions and rationale
- Observations during development
- Reminders for future sessions
- Team communications
- Technical discoveries

## Parameters

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| NOTE | Yes | 1-5 line note text to append |

## Example Usage

```bash
# Record a decision
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Decided to use JWT instead of sessions"

# Document an issue
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="User reported auth bug in production, investigating"

# Sprint planning note
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Sprint planning: focusing on US-0042 and US-0045 this week"

# Technical discovery
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Performance issue fixed: reduced API response time by 40%"

# Stakeholder feedback
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Stakeholder meeting: new feature request added to backlog"
```

## Note Format

Notes are appended with ISO 8601 timestamps:

```markdown
## Notes

- **[2024-12-31T10:30:00Z]**: Decided to use JWT instead of sessions
- **[2024-12-31T15:45:00Z]**: User reported auth bug in production
- **[2025-01-01T09:00:00Z]**: Sprint planning: focusing on US-0042 this week
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Provide Note Text

If NOTE argument is missing, you'll be prompted:

```
What note would you like to add to docs/context.md?
```

### Step 2: Diff-First Confirmation

Before writing, the command shows what will change:

```diff
## Notes

- **[2024-12-31T10:30:00Z]**: Old note here
+ - **[2025-01-07T14:22:00Z]**: New note being added
```

### Step 3: Confirm

You must approve the change before it's applied.

## Auto-Creation

### If docs/context.md doesn't exist

The command creates it with a Notes section:

```markdown
# Project Context

<!-- MANAGED_SECTION: placeholder -->
Run /agileflow:context:full to populate project context.
<!-- END_MANAGED -->

## Notes

- **[2025-01-07T14:22:00Z]**: Your note here
```

### If Notes section doesn't exist

The command adds it at the end of the file:

```markdown
[existing content...]

## Notes

- **[2025-01-07T14:22:00Z]**: Your note here
```

## Timestamp Format

All timestamps use ISO 8601 format (UTC):

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
```

Examples:
- `2024-12-31T10:30:00Z` - correct
- `2025-01-07T15:45:30Z` - correct

This ensures:
- Consistent sorting
- Universal time reference
- Machine-readable format
- Easy chronological ordering

## Chronological Order

Notes appear in the order they were added:

- **Oldest** notes at the top
- **Newest** notes at the bottom

This provides a chronological history of decisions and discoveries.

## Good Note Examples

```bash
# Technical decisions
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Switched from REST to GraphQL for complex queries"

# Bug tracking
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Fixed race condition in user auth - PR #245"

# Team coordination
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="API team ready for integration - contact @john"

# Environment changes
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Upgraded Node.js to v20 in CI - all tests passing"

# External dependencies
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Stripe API v2 deprecation - migrate by March 2025"
```

## When to Use

- **After making decisions** - Document the reasoning
- **When encountering issues** - Track problems and solutions
- **During planning** - Record sprint goals and focus areas
- **After deployments** - Note version releases
- **When blocked** - Document blockers for context

## Note vs ADR

| Use Note for | Use ADR for |
|--------------|-------------|
| Quick observations | Major architecture decisions |
| Temporary reminders | Long-term technical choices |
| Day-to-day tracking | Decisions needing justification |
| Team communications | Choices with alternatives considered |

For significant technical decisions, use [`/agileflow:adr`](/commands/adr) instead.

## Viewing Notes

Notes are visible when you:

1. View `docs/context.md` directly
2. Run `/agileflow:context:export` (if space allows)
3. Run `/agileflow:context:full` to refresh context
