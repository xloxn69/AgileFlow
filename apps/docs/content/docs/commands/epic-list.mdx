```markdown
## Epics

| Epic | Title | Status | Progress | Owner |
|------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| EP-0003 | User Dashboard | active | 2/5 (40%) | AG-UI |
| EP-0002 | Authentication | active | 4/6 (67%) | AG-API |
| EP-0001 | Core Setup | complete | 3/3 (100%) | AG-DEVOPS |

---
**Summary**: 3 epics (2 active, 1 complete)
**Stories**: 9/14 complete (64%)
```

## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Progress Bar | Action |
|--------|---------|------|--------|
| **active** | In progress, accepting new stories | Partial fill | Continue work, add stories |
| **complete** | All stories done | Full (100%) | View summary, possibly reopen |
| **on-hold** | Paused, not currently worked on | Frozen | Resume or close |

## Progress Visualization

Progress is shown as:
- **Numerator**: Completed stories
- **Denominator**: Total stories in epic
- **Percentage**: Overall completion

Example: `4/6 (67%)` = 4 stories done, 2 remaining, 67% complete

## Quick Actions

After displaying the list, you can:

### View Epic Details

Select an epic to see:
- All stories grouped by status (in_progress, ready, done)
- Progress visualization

- Related research and ADRs

```bash
/agileflow:epic:view EPIC=EP-0003

```

### Create New Epic

## Workflow Integration

### Sprint Planning

```bash
/agileflow:epic:list STATUS=active
# See which epics are in progress
/agileflow:epic:view EPIC=EP-0003
# Review stories and their status
/agileflow:sprint
# Plan which stories to work on
```

### Quarterly Planning

```bash
/agileflow:epic:list
# See all epics and their progress
# Identify bottlenecks (epics with less than 50% progress)
# Decide which epics to prioritize next
```

### Completion Tracking

```bash
/agileflow:epic:list STATUS=active
# Work on remaining stories in in-progress epics
/agileflow:epic:list STATUS=complete
# Review what was shipped
```

### On-Hold Epics

```bash
/agileflow:epic:list STATUS=on-hold
# Check if any on-hold epics can be resumed
/agileflow:epic:view EPIC=EP-0002
# Understand why it's on hold
```

## Interpreting Results

### High Progress (above 80%)

EP-0002 | Authentication | active | 5/6 (83%) | AG-API
```

- Epic is nearly complete

- Plan next epic to start
- Don't close until 100%

### Medium Progress (40-80%)

```
EP-0003 | User Dashboard | active | 3/7 (43%) | AG-UI

- Consider adding resources

### Low Progress (below 40%)
