# /agileflow:research:import

Import research results from external AI tools or content into your project's research folder with structured formatting.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:research:import TOPIC="OAuth 2.0 Setup"
```

Then paste the content when prompted. Or provide it inline:

```bash
/agileflow:research:import TOPIC="OAuth 2.0 Setup" SOURCE="https://chatgpt.com"
```

## Purpose

After using [`/agileflow:research:ask`](/commands/research-ask) to get answers from external AI, this command:

- Formats the results into structured markdown
- Saves to `docs/10-research/YYYYMMDD-topic-slug.md`
- Updates the research index automatically
- Optionally links to ADRs, Epics, or Stories

## Parameters

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| TOPIC | Yes | Name for the research file (e.g., "OAuth 2.0 Setup") |
| CONTENT | Yes* | Research results to import (*can be pasted after command) |
| SOURCE | No | Original source URL for attribution |

## What It Imports

Works with content from:

- ChatGPT responses
- Claude web conversations
- Perplexity research results
- YouTube video transcripts
- Blog posts and articles
- Conference talk notes
- Documentation pages
- Meeting notes

## Workflow

The command follows a structured workflow:

### Phase 1: Validate Inputs

1. Check TOPIC is provided (asks if missing)
2. Check CONTENT is provided (prompts to paste if missing)

### Phase 2: Analyze & Format

3. Extract key findings and summary
4. Identify code snippets (preserved exactly)
5. Generate action items
6. Create story suggestions if applicable

### Phase 3: Preview (Diff-First)

7. Show formatted result before saving
8. Ask for confirmation

### Phase 4: Save & Index

9. Save to `docs/10-research/YYYYMMDD-topic-slug.md`
10. Update `docs/10-research/README.md` index

### Phase 5: Offer Analysis (Optional)

11. Ask if you want implementation analysis
12. If yes, enter plan mode and explore your codebase
13. Suggest appropriate artifact (ADR, Epic, Story, Practice doc)

## Output Format

The imported research is structured as:

```markdown
# [Topic Title]

**Import Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Topic**: [original topic]
**Source**: [URL or "ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity research"]
**Content Type**: research

---

## Summary

[2-3 paragraph executive summary]

---

## Key Findings

- [Main point 1 with details]
- [Main point 2 with details]
- [Main point 3 with details]

---

## Implementation Approach

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

---

## Code Snippets

[ALL code snippets preserved exactly as provided]

---

---

## References

- Source: [URL]
- Import date: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## File Location

Research is saved with ISO date prefix:

```
docs/10-research/YYYYMMDD-topic-slug.md

Examples:
- docs/10-research/20250101-oauth-setup.md
- docs/10-research/20241231-stripe-webhooks.md
```

## Index Update

Every import automatically updates `docs/10-research/README.md`:

```markdown
| Date | Topic | File | Summary |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| 2025-01-01 | OAuth 2.0 Setup | 20250101-oauth-setup.md | OAuth flows, security, best practices |
| [older entries...] |
```

## Implementation Analysis

After saving, you're offered implementation analysis:

```
Would you like me to analyze how this research could be implemented in your project?

1. Yes - Enter plan mode and explore (Recommended)
2. No - Just save the research
3. Link to existing Epic/Story
```

If you choose "Yes", the command:

1. Enters plan mode
2. Gathers your project context
3. Shows benefits and implementation steps
4. Recommends the appropriate artifact type:

| Research Type | Artifact |
|---------------|----------|
| Architecture/tech decision | ADR |
| Large feature (5+ steps) | Epic + Stories |
| Single focused task | Story |
| Best practices/guidelines | Practice doc |
| Code quality improvement | Tech debt item |

## Example Usage

### Full Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Get help from ChatGPT
/agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="next-auth OAuth setup"
# Copy the generated prompt, paste into ChatGPT

# Step 2: Import the response
/agileflow:research:import TOPIC="next-auth OAuth Fix" SOURCE="https://chatgpt.com"
# Paste ChatGPT's response when prompted

# Step 3: Review and confirm
# Command shows formatted preview
# You confirm to save

# Step 4: Optionally analyze for implementation
# Choose "Yes" to enter plan mode
# Get specific recommendations for your codebase
```

### Import YouTube Transcript

```bash
/agileflow:research:import TOPIC="React 18 Streaming SSR" SOURCE="https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
# Paste the transcript
```

### Import Blog Post

```bash
/agileflow:research:import TOPIC="Vercel Edge Functions" SOURCE="https://vercel.com/blog/..."
# Paste relevant sections
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always cite the source** - Include the SOURCE argument
2. **Preserve code exactly** - Don't modify examples from AI responses
3. **Extract key findings** - Don't just paste raw content
4. **Generate action items** - Make the research actionable
5. **Link to decisions** - Reference from ADRs, Epics, Stories
