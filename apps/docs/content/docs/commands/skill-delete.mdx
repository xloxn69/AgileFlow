# /agileflow:skill:delete

Safely remove a skill from `.claude/skills/` with optional backup before deletion.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode - select which skill to delete
/agileflow:skill:delete

# Delete a specific skill
/agileflow:skill:delete supabase-swift
```

## How It Works

This command safely removes skills with built-in safeguards:

1. **Select which skill** to delete
2. **Show contents** - Display what will be removed
3. **Confirm deletion** - Multiple confirmation steps
4. **Optional export** - Backup before deleting
5. **Delete skill** - Remove the directory
6. **Verify deletion** - Confirm successful removal

## Workflow

### Step 1: Select Skill to Delete

If you don't provide a skill name, the command lists available skills:

```
Which skill would you like to delete?
  • supabase-swift - Supabase database operations for Swift
  • ui-components - React component patterns
  • api-integration - REST API client patterns
```

### Step 2: Show Skill Contents

Before deletion, the command displays exactly what will be removed:

```
⚠️  About to delete: supabase-swift
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This will permanently remove:
  .claude/skills/supabase-swift/
  ├── SKILL.md
  ├── references.md
  ├── cookbook/
  │   ├── crud-operations.md
  │   └── authentication.md
  └── .mcp.json

Total: 5 files in 2 directories

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 3: Confirm Deletion

The command requires explicit confirmation:

```
Are you sure you want to delete this skill? This cannot be undone.
  • Yes, delete permanently
  • No, keep it
  • Export first (save a backup before deleting)
```

### Step 4: Handle Export (if requested)

If you choose "Export first":

1. Creates backup directory: `.claude/skills-backup/`
2. Copies skill with timestamp:
   ```bash
   cp -r .claude/skills/<skill> .claude/skills-backup/<skill>-20251227-143052/
   ```
3. Shows backup location:
   ```
   ✅ Backed up: .claude/skills-backup/supabase-swift-20251227-143052/

   You can restore this later by copying the backup folder back to .claude/skills/
   ```
4. Returns to deletion confirmation

### Step 5: Delete Skill

Once confirmed:

```bash
rm -rf .claude/skills/<skill>/
```

### Step 6: Confirm Deletion

Shows success message:

```
✅ Deleted: supabase-swift

The skill has been permanently removed from .claude/skills/
```

### Step 7: Offer Next Actions

After deletion:

```
What would you like to do next?
  • Delete another skill
  • Create new skill
  • List remaining skills
  • Done
```

## Backup Location

Backups are stored in `.claude/skills-backup/` with timestamps:

```
.claude/skills-backup/supabase-swift-20251227-143052/
├── SKILL.md
├── references.md
├── cookbook/
│   ├── crud-operations.md
│   └── authentication.md
└── .mcp.json
```

**Timestamp format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS`

### Restoring a Backup

To restore a deleted skill:

```bash
# List available backups
ls -la .claude/skills-backup/

# Restore a specific backup
cp -r .claude/skills-backup/supabase-swift-20251227-143052 .claude/skills/supabase-swift
```

Or use a single command:

```bash
# Find and restore the most recent backup of a skill
cp -r $(ls -td .claude/skills-backup/supabase-swift-* | head -1) .claude/skills/supabase-swift
```

## Safety Features

The command includes multiple safety mechanisms:

1. **Always confirm** - Never deletes without explicit confirmation
2. **Show contents** - Displays exactly what will be removed
3. **Export option** - Allow backup before deletion
4. **One at a time** - No batch delete to prevent accidents
5. **Timestamp backups** - Never overwrites previous backups
6. **Clear messages** - Explicit success/failure feedback

## Error Handling

### Skill Not Found

```
❌ Skill "<name>" not found.

Available skills:
  - ui-components
  - api-integration

Use /agileflow:skill:list to see all skills.
```

### No Skills Installed

```
❌ No skills to delete.

No skills are currently installed in .claude/skills/
```

### Delete Failed

```
❌ Failed to delete skill: <error message>

The skill directory may be in use or have permission issues.
Try manually: rm -rf .claude/skills/<skill>/
```

## Delete Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delete and Keep Backup

```bash
/agileflow:skill:delete supabase-swift
# Choose: Export first
# Choose: Yes, delete permanently
# Result: Skill deleted, backup saved in .claude/skills-backup/
```

### Scenario 2: Delete Without Backup

```bash
/agileflow:skill:delete ui-components
# Choose: Yes, delete permanently
# Result: Skill deleted immediately
```

### Scenario 3: Cancel Deletion

```bash
/agileflow:skill:delete api-integration
# Choose: No, keep it
# Result: No changes, skill remains
```

## Backing Up All Skills

Before deleting or updating multiple skills, backup your entire skills directory:

```bash
# Create complete backup
cp -r .claude/skills .claude/skills-backup-complete-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# This creates: .claude/skills-backup-complete-20251227/
```

## Cleanup

### Remove Old Backups

To save space, clean up old backups:

```bash
# Remove backups older than 30 days
find .claude/skills-backup -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

### Remove All Backups

If you're sure you don't need any backups:

```bash
# Remove entire backup directory
rm -rf .claude/skills-backup

# Or remove only backups for a specific skill
rm -rf .claude/skills-backup/supabase-swift-*
```

## When to Delete Skills

Consider deleting a skill when:

- **No longer needed** - Your project no longer uses this technology
- **Replaced by newer skill** - You created an improved version
- **Consolidating** - Merging multiple similar skills
- **Cleaning up** - Removing experimental or test skills
- **Freeing space** - Skills aren't being used or referenced

## Alternative to Deletion

Instead of deleting, you can:

1. **Archive skills** - Move unused skills to a separate directory
2. **Rename skills** - Prefix with "archived-" using `/agileflow:skill:edit`
3. **Disable in SKILL.md** - Add deprecation notice
4. **Create new version** - Keep old, create improved version

## Tips

- **Export before deleting** - You can always restore backups
- **Batch backup first** - Backup all skills before major changes
- **Document why** - Note why you deleted something for team clarity
- **Check git** - If skills are version controlled, commit before deleting
