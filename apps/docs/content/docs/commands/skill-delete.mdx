# /skill:delete

Safely remove a skill from `.claude/skills/` with full safety features including preview, confirmation, and optional backup.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode
/agileflow:skill:delete

# Delete specific skill
/agileflow:skill:delete supabase-swift
```

## What It Does

The delete command:

1. **Shows what will be deleted** - Tree view of all files
2. **Confirms with you** - Requires explicit approval
3. **Offers backup option** - Save a copy before deleting
4. **Permanently removes** - Deletes the skill directory
5. **Suggests next actions** - What to do after deletion

## Safety Features

This command has multiple safety layers:

- **No accidental deletion** - Always confirm before removing
- **Tree view preview** - See exactly what's deleted
- **Backup option** - Export skill before deletion
- **One at a time** - Delete individual skills (no batch delete)
- **Clear confirmation** - Explicit YES/NO choice

## Workflow

### Step 1: Select Skill

If you don't specify a skill:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:delete
```

**Choose from available skills:**
```
Which skill would you like to delete?

[1] supabase-swift
    Supabase database operations for Swift iOS apps

[2] ui-components (deprecated)
    Old component patterns (no longer using)

[3] api-error-handling
    REST API error handling patterns

Select: 2
```

### Step 2: Preview What Will Be Deleted

The command shows exactly what's in the skill:

```
⚠️  About to delete: ui-components
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This will permanently remove:

  .claude/skills/ui-components/
  ├── SKILL.md

## Backup Management

### Backup Location

Backups are saved with timestamp:

```
.claude/skills-backup/
├── ui-components-20251208-093000/
├── api-client-20251208-103500/
└── database-20251209-150000/
```

Format: `<skill-name>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/`

### Restore from Backup

If you delete a skill and want it back:

```bash
# Copy from backup
cp -r .claude/skills-backup/supabase-swift-20251209-150000 \
      .claude/skills/supabase-swift

# Verify it works
/agileflow:skill:test supabase-swift
```

### Clean Old Backups

Periodically remove old backups:

```bash
# List backups
ls -la .claude/skills-backup/

# Remove old backup
rm -rf .claude/skills-backup/old-skill-20250101-120000/
```

## When to Delete

Delete skills when:

- **No longer needed** - Technology is deprecated
- **Outdated** - Better alternative exists
- **Duplicated** - Consolidated into one skill
- **Low quality** - Skill isn't helpful
- **Organization** - Too many similar skills

## Before Deleting

Consider:

1. **Are you sure?** - Deletion is permanent
2. **Document why** - Note in git commit
3. **Backup first** - Use "Export first" option
4. **Create replacement** - If consolidating skills
5. **Notify team** - If shared in git

## Alternative to Delete

Instead of deleting, you could:

1. **Rename** to indicate deprecated:
   ```bash
   /agileflow:skill:edit <skill-name>
   # Select "Rename skill"
   # Rename to: deprecated-<old-name>
   ```

2. **Archive** by moving out of active skills:
   ```bash
   mv .claude/skills/old-skill .claude/skills-archive/
   ```

3. **Mark in documentation**:
   - Edit SKILL.md to add deprecation notice
   - Still available but marked as obsolete

## Error Handling

### Skill Not Found

```
❌ Skill "<name>" not found.

Available skills:
  - supabase-swift
  - ui-components
  - api-error-handling

Use /agileflow:skill:list to see all skills.
```

**Fix**: Check the skill name spelling, or list available skills.

### No Skills to Delete

```
❌ No skills to delete.

No skills are currently installed in .claude/skills/

Create a skill first: /agileflow:skill:create
```

**Fix**: Create a skill before trying to delete one.

### Delete Failed

```
❌ Failed to delete skill: Permission denied

The skill directory may be in use or have permission issues.
Try manually: rm -rf .claude/skills/<skill>/
```

**Fix**: Check file permissions:
```bash
ls -la .claude/skills/<skill>/
chmod -R u+w .claude/skills/<skill>/
rm -rf .claude/skills/<skill>/
```

### Backup Creation Failed

```
⚠️  Could not create backup.

Check permissions for:
  .claude/skills-backup/

Manual backup:
  cp -r .claude/skills/<skill> .claude/skills-backup/
```

**Fix**: Ensure backup directory is writable:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills-backup/
chmod u+w .claude/skills-backup/
```

## Best Practices

### Deletion Workflow

1. **Use `/skill:list`** to see all skills
2. **Test before deleting** if unsure:
   ```bash
   /agileflow:skill:test <skill-name>
   ```
3. **Use "Export first"** option for backup
4. **Confirm deletion** explicitly
5. **Note in git** why skill was deleted

### Backup Strategy

1. **Always export** for skills created over a month ago
2. **Keep backups** for 30 days minimum
3. **Document** which skills are backed up
4. **Test restores** periodically

### Team Workflow

If sharing skills in git:

1. **Commit deletion** with reason:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Remove: deprecated-api-client skill - \
   consolidated into api-integration skill"
   ```

2. **Notify team** of deletion

3. **Keep backup** in git branch (optional):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b backup-deprecated-skills
   git checkout main
   ```
