# /adr:update

Update an existing ADR's status or add amendments documenting status changes.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0042 STATUS=accepted REASON="Team approved after review"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NUMBER` | Yes | - | ADR number to update (4-digit, e.g., 0042) |
| `STATUS` | No | - | New status: `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, `superseded` |
| `REASON` | No | - | Reason for the status change |
| `SUPERSEDED_BY` | No | - | If superseding, the new ADR number (e.g., 0045) |

## Examples

### Accept a Proposed ADR

```bash
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0042 STATUS=accepted REASON="Team approved after security review"
```

### Deprecate an ADR

```bash
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0035 STATUS=deprecated REASON="Context changed, approach is no longer applicable"
```

### Mark ADR as Superseded

```bash
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0042 STATUS=superseded SUPERSEDED_BY=0045 REASON="New requirements made this approach obsolete"
```

### Reactivate Deprecated ADR

```bash
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0030 STATUS=accepted REASON="Reconsidered in light of new project constraints"
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0042
```

Without STATUS or REASON, the command guides you through the update process.

## Status Transitions

### Valid Transitions

| From | To | Common Reason |
|------|-----|---------------|
| `proposed` | `accepted` | Team approved decision |
| `proposed` | `rejected` | Alternative chosen, not viable |
| `accepted` | `deprecated` | No longer relevant, context changed |
| `accepted` | `superseded` | Better approach found, replaced by new ADR |
| `deprecated` | `accepted` | Reconsidered, still valid |
| `superseded` | `accepted` | Replacement didn't work out |

## Workflow

When you run the command:

1. **Validates** the ADR exists
2. **Asks for new status** (if not provided)
3. **Requires a reason** for any status change
4. **Shows preview** of what will be updated
5. **Asks for confirmation** before writing
6. **Appends amendment** documenting the change
7. **Updates frontmatter** with new status and timestamp

## Amendment Format

When an ADR status changes, the command appends an Amendment section:

```markdown
## Amendment - 2024-12-30

**Status changed**: accepted → superseded
**Reason**: New requirements made this approach obsolete.
**Superseded by**: [ADR-0045: New Approach](adr-0045-new-approach.md)
**Updated**: 2024-12-30
```

The original ADR content is preserved; amendments document the change.

## Examples by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Approving a Proposed Decision

```bash
# A team member proposed using a new framework
# After review meeting, you approve it

/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0047 STATUS=accepted REASON="Team consensus in architecture review meeting 2024-12-30. Framework choice validated against scalability requirements."
```

Result: ADR-0047 now marked as `accepted` with documented approval.

### Scenario 2: Replacing an Old Approach

```bash
# You've found a better approach to database caching
# The old ADR (0041) should be superseded by new ADR (0050)

/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0041 STATUS=superseded SUPERSEDED_BY=0050 REASON="New caching strategy provides 3x better performance with simpler implementation. See ADR-0050 for details."
```

Result: ADR-0041 marked as `superseded` with link to ADR-0050.

### Scenario 3: Reconsidering a Deprecated Decision

```bash
# Project direction changed, old approach might be relevant again
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0020 STATUS=accepted REASON="Project switched to microservices architecture. Original monolithic approach may apply to specific subdomain. Reactivating for team consideration."
```

Result: ADR-0020 unmarked as deprecated, now `accepted` for discussion.

### Scenario 4: Documenting Context Change

```bash
# Business requirements changed, a decision no longer applies
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0038 STATUS=deprecated REASON="Support for legacy browsers dropped in new product roadmap. This ADR addressed IE11 compatibility which is no longer required."
```

Result: ADR-0038 marked as `deprecated` explaining why it's obsolete.

## Best Practices

### When to Update ADR Status

- **Approve** proposed ADRs after team review
- **Deprecate** if context or requirements change
- **Supersede** when a newer ADR replaces this approach
- **Reactivate** if circumstances change and old decision is relevant again

### Writing Good Reasons

**Good reasons:**
- "Team consensus after architecture review"
- "New performance requirements make this approach inefficient"
- "Business requirement removed the constraint that triggered this decision"
- "Successfully implemented and validated in production"

**Poor reasons:**
- "No longer needed"
- "Better approach exists"
- "Team decided"

### Documenting Supersession

When superseding an ADR:
1. Always include `SUPERSEDED_BY` with new ADR number
2. Explain why the new approach is better
3. Reference the new ADR for implementation details
4. Keep the original ADR intact for history

### Creating Implementation Work

After approving an ADR:

```bash
# Mark ADR as accepted
/agileflow:adr:update NUMBER=0050 STATUS=accepted REASON="Team approved in review"

# View the ADR to plan implementation
/agileflow:adr:view NUMBER=0050

# Create stories or epic from the ADR
/agileflow:epic TITLE="Implement ADR-0050" ...
```
