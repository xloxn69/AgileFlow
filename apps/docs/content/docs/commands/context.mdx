# /context

Create, refresh, and manage your project context brief for use in web AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude web.

## Overview

The `/context` command family helps you maintain and export project context for web-based AI tools. This is useful when you need to:

- Generate a comprehensive context brief for pasting into web AI tools
- Export a concise excerpt for quick context loading
- Record important decisions and discoveries in your context file
- Keep external AI tools informed about your project status

## Subcommands

The `/context` command has three subcommands, each with a specific purpose:

### /agileflow:context:full

**Generate or refresh the comprehensive project context brief.**

Creates or updates `docs/context.md` with managed sections containing:
- What we're building and current focus
- Feature map and tech/tooling summary
- Key decisions (ADRs) and architecture snapshot
- Testing & CI status
- Recent progress
- Risks and next steps

This file is designed to be pasted into ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Claude web to give external AI tools full project context.

**Usage:**
```bash
/agileflow:context:full
```

**Behavior:**
- Reads existing `docs/context.md` if present
- Gathers data from status.json, ADRs, epics, stories, and CHANGELOG
- Updates only managed sections (between `<!-- MANAGED_SECTION -->` markers)
- Preserves any user-written content outside managed sections
- Shows diff before applying changes
- Requires confirmation before writing

---

### /agileflow:context:export

**Export a concise context excerpt for pasting into web AI tools.**

Reads `docs/context.md` and outputs a condensed excerpt (≤300 lines) ready to copy and paste into ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Claude web.

This is a **read-only command** - no files are written.

**Usage:**
```bash
/agileflow:context:export
```

**Behavior:**
- Reads `docs/context.md`
- Extracts key sections (overview, current focus, tech stack, decisions, feature map, next steps)
- Outputs concise excerpt in a code block
- Includes instructions for pasting into web AI
- Does not require confirmation

---

### /agileflow:context:note

**Append a timestamped note to the context file.**

Quickly add a note to `docs/context.md` under the "Notes" section. Useful for recording decisions, observations, or reminders that should persist in project context.

**Usage:**
```bash
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Your note here"
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| NOTE | Yes | 1-5 line note text to append |

**Behavior:**
- Reads or creates `docs/context.md`
- Creates a "Notes" section if it doesn't exist
- Appends note with ISO timestamp (e.g., `2024-12-31T10:30:00Z`)
- Shows diff before applying changes
- Requires confirmation before writing

---

## Examples

### Generate Full Context

```bash
/agileflow:context:full
```

Creates or updates `docs/context.md` with comprehensive project information:

### Add a Quick Note

```bash
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="User reported critical bug with OAuth flow on mobile"
```

Appends a timestamped note to the "Notes" section of `docs/context.md`:

```markdown
## Notes

## Workflow Examples

### Keep Context Fresh

Keep context updated for better AI assistance:

```bash
# After each major milestone
/agileflow:context:full

# Before starting work in web AI
/agileflow:context:export
# Copy output and paste into ChatGPT/Perplexity
```

---

### Use in Web AI Conversations

Before asking web AI to help with your project:

```bash
# Export concise context
/agileflow:context:export

# Copy output and paste as initial message in ChatGPT
# Then ask your question with full project context
```

---

### Capture Important Discoveries

```bash
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="TypeScript 5.4 improves type inference for generics"
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Need to upgrade Node.js to 20+ for new features"
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Team prefers MUI components over shadcn/ui"
```

---

## Output Modes

### /agileflow:context:full (Create/Update Context)

**Input**: Gathers information from:
- `status.json` - Current work and story status
- `bus/log.jsonl` - Recent progress messages
- `docs/03-decisions/` - Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- `docs/04-architecture/` - System design documentation
- `docs/05-epics/` - Feature roadmap and epics
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history
- `package.json` - Project metadata

**Output**: Updates `docs/context.md` with managed sections while preserving custom content

**Key Behavior**:
- Diff-first: Shows changes before writing
- Managed sections: Only updates content between `<!-- MANAGED_SECTION -->` markers
- Preserves user content: Never modifies content outside managed sections
- Requires confirmation: User must approve changes

---

### /agileflow:context:export (Copy to Web AI)

**Input**: Reads existing `docs/context.md`

**Output**: Concise excerpt (≤300 lines) ready to paste into ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Claude web

**Use Case**: Load project context into web AI tool to continue work in a fresh conversation

**Key Behavior**:
- Read-only: No files are modified
- Self-contained: Includes instructions for pasting
- Format-ready: Already formatted for easy copy-paste

---

### /agileflow:context:note (Append Timestamped Note)

**Input**: NOTE argument with 1-5 line note

**Output**: Appends to "Notes" section with ISO timestamp

**Use Case**: Quick capture of important events, decisions, or discoveries

**Key Behavior**:
- Diff-first: Shows changes before writing
- Creates section if missing: Automatically creates "Notes" section if needed
- Chronological: Notes appear in order with newest at bottom
- Timestamped: Every note includes ISO 8601 timestamp

---

## Best Practices

### Regular Context Updates

Keep context fresh for better AI assistance:

1. **After major milestones**: Run `/agileflow:context:full` to capture completed work
2. **Before web AI sessions**: Run `/agileflow:context:export` and paste into ChatGPT
3. **During development**: Use `/agileflow:context:note` to record decisions and discoveries

```bash
# Recommended workflow
/agileflow:context:full        # Update full context
/agileflow:context:export      # Get concise version
# Paste into web AI for context-aware help
```

---

### Capture Important Discoveries

Record technical insights and decisions:

```bash
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="TypeScript 5.4 improves type inference - consider upgrading"
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Stripe API changed pagination in v2.0 - update integration"
/agileflow:context:note NOTE="Team consensus: use Postgres over MongoDB for this project"
```

---

### Use in Web AI Conversations

Maximize effectiveness of web AI tools by providing context:

1. Export concise context: `/agileflow:context:export`
2. Copy the output
3. Paste into ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini as your first message
4. Ask follow-up questions with full project context

This ensures the web AI understands your codebase, architecture, and current focus.

---

### Manage Context File Size

For large projects, manage context.md file size:

- Use `/agileflow:context:export` to check current context size
- Archive old notes if they grow beyond 100+ entries
- Create separate research files for deep dives
- Use `/agileflow:research:ask` for complex research topics

---

## Diff-First Workflow

All context commands that modify files follow a consistent workflow:

1. **Show Changes**: Command displays proposed changes as a diff
2. **Confirm**: You review changes and approve or reject
3. **Apply**: Changes are written only after your confirmation

This ensures you never lose important information and always know what's being modified.

## Related Commands

- [`/adr`](/commands/adr) - Create architecture decision records
- [`/research`](/commands/research) - Create and manage research notes
- [`/docs-sync`](/commands/docs-sync) - Synchronize documentation
- [`/readme-sync`](/commands/readme-sync) - Update README files

---

## Notes

- Context files are stored in `docs/context.md` as part of your local project documentation
- Managed sections use HTML comments as markers and should not be edited manually
- The export command respects the 300-line limit to fit in web AI tool context windows
- Notes are timestamped in ISO 8601 format for consistency and easy sorting
