# /agileflow:research:list

Display all research notes stored in your project with a quick overview.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:research:list
```

No arguments needed—shows all research notes.

## Purpose

Shows research notes stored in `docs/10-research/` with:

- Date
- Topic
- Filename
- One-line summary (if available)

This is a **read-only command**—no files are written.

## Output

```
## Research Notes

| Date       | Topic                  | File                        |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 2025-01-07 | OAuth Integration       | 20250107-oauth.md           |
| 2025-01-06 | Performance Tips        | 20250106-perf.md            |
| 2025-01-05 | Database Migrations     | 20250105-migrations.md      |

Total: 3 research notes

Quick actions:
- /agileflow:research:view FILE=<filename> - Read a specific note
- /agileflow:research:analyze FILE=<filename> - Analyze for implementation
- /agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="new topic" - Create new research prompt
- /agileflow:research:import TOPIC="..." - Import external content
```

## When No Research Exists

If no research notes are found:

```
No research notes found.

Quick start:
- /agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="your topic" - Generate research prompt for ChatGPT/Claude
- /agileflow:research:import TOPIC="..." - Import external content
```

## How It Works

1. Reads `docs/10-research/README.md` for the index table
2. If README doesn't exist, lists files from the directory
3. If directory doesn't exist, shows helpful message
4. Suggests next actions

## Quick Actions

After viewing the list, you can:

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Read a note | `/agileflow:research:view FILE=<filename>` |
| Analyze for implementation | `/agileflow:research:analyze FILE=<filename>` |
| Create new research | `/agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="..."` |
| Import content | `/agileflow:research:import TOPIC="..."` |

## When to Use

- **Before implementing** - Find past research on a topic
- **Looking for code snippets** - Remember where you researched something
- **Check action items** - See what tasks came from research
- **Team knowledge sharing** - Browse what's been researched
