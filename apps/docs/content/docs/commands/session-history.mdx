## Use Cases

### Reviewing Work Patterns

```bash
/agileflow:session:history DAYS=30
# See how many sessions you've used
# Identify if you're creating too many abandoned sessions
```

### Finding Old Sessions

```bash
/agileflow:session:history DAYS=all
# Find a session from weeks ago
# Check if its worktree still exists
```

### Cleanup Decisions

```bash
/agileflow:session:history
# See which sessions have worktrees kept
# Decide which to clean up
```

## Data Storage

```json
