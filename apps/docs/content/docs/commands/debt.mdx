# /debt

Track and visualize technical debt across the codebase. Identify, categorize, and prioritize refactoring work with data-driven scoring.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:debt
```

Runs a quick scan and generates a debt report with default settings.

Or with custom options:

```bash
/agileflow:debt SCAN=full OUTPUT=report THRESHOLD=medium
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SCAN` | No | `quick` | Scan depth: `quick` (flagged areas only) or `full` (entire codebase) |
| `OUTPUT` | No | `report` | Output type: `report`, `stories`, or `both` |
| `THRESHOLD` | No | `medium` | Minimum severity: `high`, `medium`, or `low` |

## What It Detects

The debt scanner identifies multiple types of technical debt:

### Code Quality Signals
- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
- Long functions (>50 lines)
- High cyclomatic complexity (>10)
- Duplicated code blocks
- Large files (>500 lines)
- Deep nesting (>4 levels)
- God objects (>10 methods)
- Low test coverage (under 70%)

### Story-Based Debt
Searches stories tagged with `tech-debt: true` or with "refactor" or "cleanup" in the title.

### Architecture Debt
Checks ADRs for deprecated decisions or documented negative consequences.

### Git History Analysis
- Files with high churn (frequently modified)
- Files with many authors (unclear ownership)
- Old branches not yet merged

### Linter Output
Parses output from ESLint, TypeScript, Pylint, SonarQube, and coverage reports.

## Debt Categories

Technical debt is organized into seven categories:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Architecture** | Wrong abstractions, tight coupling, missing patterns | Service coupling, circular dependencies |
| **Code Quality** | Duplication, complexity, inconsistent style | Copy-paste code, high complexity |
| **Documentation** | Missing, outdated, or incomplete docs | Undocumented APIs, stale guides |
| **Testing** | Low coverage, flaky tests, missing E2E | No unit tests, missing integration tests |
| **Security** | Outdated deps, exposed secrets, weak auth | CVE-vulnerable packages, hardcoded tokens |
| **Performance** | N+1 queries, memory leaks, slow ops | Inefficient algorithms, memory bloat |
| **Dependencies** | Outdated packages, unmaintained libraries | Years-old libraries, abandoned projects |

## Scoring Formula

Each debt item receives a score from 0-100:

```
Score = (Severity × Scope × Pain) / 10

Severity: 1-10 (impact level)
Scope:    1-10 (files affected)
Pain:     1-10 (developer frustration)
```

### Severity Levels
- **Low** (1-3): Minor issue, doesn't block anything
- **Medium** (4-6): Moderate issue, slows down development
- **High** (7-9): Significant issue, blocks features or causes bugs
- **Critical** (10): Urgent, causes production issues or blocks work

## Examples

### Quick Scan (Default)

```bash
/agileflow:debt
```

Scans areas marked with TODO/FIXME and tagged stories. Generates report.

### Full Codebase Scan

```bash
/agileflow:debt SCAN=full
```

Deep scan of entire codebase including complexity analysis, duplication detection, and coverage analysis.

### Generate Stories for Critical Debt

```bash
/agileflow:debt SCAN=quick OUTPUT=stories THRESHOLD=high
```

Finds critical debt items and optionally creates stories for them.

### Generate Both Report and Stories

```bash
/agileflow:debt SCAN=full OUTPUT=both THRESHOLD=medium
```

Creates debt report and generates stories for debt items above medium severity.

## Output Example

```markdown
# Technical Debt Report

**Generated**: 2025-12-24T10:30:00Z
**Total Debt Items**: 42
**Critical**: 3 | **High**: 12 | **Medium**: 18 | **Low**: 9
**Total Estimated Effort**: 48 days

---

## Critical Debt (Score >80)

### 1. Auth service tightly coupled to database
**Type**: Architecture | **Score**: 87
**Impact**: Blocks US-0055 (Add OAuth), US-0061 (Add 2FA)
**Files**: src/services/auth.ts (287 lines, complexity 18)
**Estimate**: 3-5 days
**ADR**: ADR-0003 recommends service layer separation (not implemented)

### 2. Missing integration tests for payment flow
**Type**: Testing | **Score**: 85
**Impact**: High risk for regressions, blocking production
**Files**: src/api/payments/*.ts (12 files, 0% coverage)
**Last Incident**: 2025-09-15 (payment processing bug)
**Estimate**: 2-3 days

---

## High Debt (Score 60-80)
[12 items...]

---

## Summary by Category

| Category | Count | Avg Score | Estimated Effort |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Architecture | 8 | 72 | 15 days |
| Code Quality | 15 | 58 | 8 days |
| Testing | 10 | 65 | 12 days |
| Security | 3 | 78 | 5 days |
| Performance | 4 | 61 | 6 days |

## Debt Heatmap (Most Problematic Files)

- src/services/auth.ts: 3 items (architecture, complexity, coupling)
- src/api/payments/process.ts: 2 items (no tests, deprecated API)
- src/utils/legacy.ts: 2 items (duplication, no docs)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate** (Critical): Address auth refactor and payment tests
2. **This Sprint**: Tackle 3 high-severity items (by ROI)
3. **Next Sprint**: Reserve 20% capacity for debt reduction
4. **Ongoing**: Require tests for all new code (enforce in CI)
```

## Workflow

After generating a debt report, you can:

### 1. Review the Report
Understand what debt exists and where it is.

### 2. Generate Stories (Optional)
```bash
/agileflow:debt OUTPUT=stories
```

Creates stories for critical debt items with:
- Acceptance criteria focused on "before/after" state
- Impact analysis
- Estimated effort
- References to affected features

### 3. Save to Documentation
```bash
/agileflow:debt OUTPUT=report
```

Saves report to `docs/08-project/tech-debt-YYYYMMDD.md` and updates the README with a link.

### 4. Create Debt Epic
If many critical items exist, creates an epic:
- EP-XXXX: Technical Debt Reduction
- Stories for top 5 critical items
- Tracks debt reduction progress

## Using Debt Information

### Plan Sprints
Reserve 10-20% of each sprint for debt reduction:

```bash
/agileflow:sprint --include-debt --debt-threshold=high
```

### Retrospectives
Track debt reduction in retrospectives:

```bash
/agileflow:retro --analyze-debt
```

### Dashboard
Create a debt dashboard that updates weekly:

```
docs/08-project/debt-dashboard.md

# Debt Dashboard (Weekly)

Week 52: 42 items (↑ from 39)
Week 51: 39 items (↓ from 43)

Critical: 3 items (target: reduce to 1 this sprint)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Honest About Estimates**: Err on the high side
2. **Link to Features**: Prioritize debt blocking new work
3. **Celebrate Reductions**: Recognize debt paydown in retros
4. **Prevent Accumulation**: Enforce testing in CI for new code
5. **Review Regularly**: Run debt scan monthly or quarterly

## Debt Prevention

Add debt review to your CI/CD:

```yaml
# Run weekly technical debt scan
- cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Every Monday
  name: Technical debt scan
  run: /agileflow:debt SCAN=full OUTPUT=report
```

## Integration with Development

When implementing features, check if they create debt:

```bash
# Before completing story
/agileflow:debt SCAN=quick THRESHOLD=high

# If debt created, track in story
/agileflow:status STORY=US-0042 TECH_DEBT=true DEBT_SCORE=42
```

## Story Template for Debt

When creating stories for debt items:

```markdown
---
story_id: US-XXXX
title: Refactor auth service to separate concerns
type: tech-debt
debt_score: 87
estimate: 3d
---

## Current State (Before)
- auth.ts contains DB queries, business logic, and HTTP handling
- 287 lines, complexity 18
- Hard to test, hard to extend

## Desired State (After)
- Clear separation: AuthService, AuthRepository, AuthController
- Each <100 lines, complexity <8
- 80%+ test coverage
- Enables US-0055 (OAuth)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AuthRepository handles all DB operations
- [ ] AuthService contains only business logic
- [ ] AuthController handles only HTTP/routing
- [ ] Tests cover each layer independently
- [ ] All existing auth tests still pass
```
