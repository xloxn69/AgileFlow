# /story-validate

Validate a story's completeness, clarity, and readiness for development before assigning to an agent.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:story-validate STORY=<US-ID>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `STORY` | Yes | - | Story identifier (e.g., US-0001) |

## Examples

### Validate Before Development

```bash
/agileflow:story-validate STORY=US-0042
```

Performs comprehensive validation on the story and returns a detailed report showing what's complete and what needs fixing.

### Check a Story from Different Epic

```bash
/agileflow:story-validate STORY=US-0085
```

The command automatically locates the story file regardless of which epic it belongs to.

## Output

The validation report includes:

### PASSED Checks
Shows all validation criteria that passed:
- Required sections present
- Acceptance criteria clear and testable
- Architecture context populated with sources
- Dependencies documented
- Estimation is realistic

### FAILED Issues
Shows critical problems that must be fixed:
- Missing required sections (AC, Architecture Context)
- Unclear acceptance criteria (not Given/When/Then format)
- Missing source citations in architecture context
- Unverified dependencies
- Unrealistic estimation

### WARNINGS
Shows minor issues or suggestions:
- Dependencies could be clearer
- Acceptance criteria could be more specific
- Dev Agent Record placeholder text
- Suggested improvements

## Validation Checklist

The command validates:

### 1. Required Sections
- Story metadata (ID, epic, owner, estimate, status)
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then format)
- Architecture Context with subsections
- Testing Strategy
- Dev Agent Record (structure)
- Dependencies (if applicable)

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Quality
- Uses Given/When/Then format (not bullet points alone)
- 2-5 criteria (not too many, not too few)
- Specific and measurable
- References implementation details
- Each criterion is independently testable

### 3. Architecture Context
- Section exists with real content
- Includes source citations: `[Source: architecture/{file}.md#{section}]`
- All referenced files exist in `docs/04-architecture/`
- Content is extracted (not invented)

### 4. Estimation
- Estimate is one of: 0.5d, 1d, 1.5d, 2d
- For >2d: suggests breaking into smaller stories
- Realistic for story scope

### 5. Dependencies
- Format is clear: "Depends on US-#### (description)"
- Referenced stories exist in status.json
- No circular dependencies
- Blocked stories have documented reasons

## Workflow

1. **Create story** - Use `/story` to create new story
2. **Validate completeness** - Run `/story-validate` to check before development
3. **Fix issues** - Address any failed checks or warnings
4. **Run again** - Re-validate after fixes
5. **Develop** - Story is ready when all checks pass

## Example Report

```text
🔍 Story Validation Report
==========================
Story: US-0042 - User login form
File: docs/06-stories/EP-0010/US-0042-user-login-form.md
Status: ready

✅ PASSED (11 checks)
------------------
- All required sections present
- Acceptance criteria in proper format
- Architecture context populated
- All source citations valid
- Dependencies documented
- Estimate is realistic
- Owner assigned and appropriate
- Dev Agent Record structured
- No circular dependencies detected
- Story within epic scope
- Title is clear and descriptive

❌ FAILED (0 issues)
-------------------
[None]

⚠️ WARNINGS (1 issue)
-----------------------
Warning: Architecture Context could be more detailed
  Suggestion: Add more specific API endpoint references

📊 SUMMARY
----------
Architecture Context: ✓ populated
Acceptance Criteria: ✓ clear
Dependencies: ✓ documented
Dev Agent Record: ✓ structured
Ready for Development: YES

Next Steps:
1. Story is ready! Assign to owner with /agileflow:assign US-0042
2. Or include in next sprint with /agileflow:sprint
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: "Architecture Context missing"
**Fix**: Add sections for Data Models, API Specs, Components with source citations to `docs/04-architecture/`.

### Issue: "Acceptance criteria not in Given/When/Then format"
**Fix**: Rewrite criteria following the pattern:
```text
- Given [precondition]
  When [action]
  Then [expected outcome]
```

### Issue: "Source citation not found"
**Fix**: Verify the file exists in `docs/04-architecture/` and use correct section anchor.

### Issue: "Estimate seems high for scope"
**Fix**: Consider breaking story into smaller ones or providing justification in Technical Notes.

### Issue: "Circular dependency detected"
**Fix**: Review dependency chain and resolve - stories cannot be completed if they depend on each other.

## Integration with Other Commands

- **After creation**: Always run `/story-validate` before assigning
- **Before assignment**: Use `/assign` only after validation passes
- **Before sprint**: Use `/sprint` with validated stories
- **During development**: Reference validation report for context
- **For updates**: Re-validate if story is significantly modified

## Best Practices

- **Validate before assigning** - Catch issues early before development starts
- **Review failed checks carefully** - Each one has a specific suggestion
- **Don't ignore warnings** - They often indicate quality improvements
- **Use architecture docs** - Proper citations make stories clearer for developers
- **Keep AC focused** - 2-5 criteria that cover main scenarios
- **Test your stories** - Validation checks clarity, not correctness
