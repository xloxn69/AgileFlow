# /readme-sync

Keep folder README.md files up-to-date by automatically generating a contents section that matches the actual files in the folder.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:readme-sync FOLDER=docs/02-practices
```

To sync all documentation folders at once:

```bash
/agileflow:readme-sync FOLDER=all
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FOLDER` | No | - | Path to folder (e.g., `docs/02-practices`), or `all` to sync entire docs/ |

## Examples

### Sync Single Folder

```bash
/agileflow:readme-sync FOLDER=docs/02-practices
```

Scans `docs/02-practices/` for all files and subdirectories, then updates the `## Contents` section of `docs/02-practices/README.md` with current items.

### Sync All Documentation Folders

```bash
/agileflow:readme-sync FOLDER=all
```

Automatically syncs all folders in `docs/` directory in parallel:
- `docs/00-meta/`
- `docs/01-brainstorming/`
- `docs/02-practices/`
- `docs/03-decisions/`
- ... and more

### Interactive Folder Selection

```bash
/agileflow:readme-sync
```

If you don't specify a folder, the command asks you to choose:

```
Which folder should I sync?

1. docs/02-practices (Recommended)
2. docs/04-architecture
3. all
4. Other (enter custom path)
```

## Output

The command generates a `## Contents` section in the README:

```markdown
## Contents

- **testing.md** – Test strategy, patterns, and test infrastructure
- **git-branching.md** – Git workflow, branching strategy, and commit conventions
- **ci.md** – CI/CD pipeline configuration and testing gates
- **security.md** – Security practices, input validation, and authentication
- **releasing.md** – Release procedures, versioning, and changelog management

### Sub-folder: design/
- **design/colors.md** – Color palette and branding guidelines
- **design/typography.md** – Font stack and text styling rules
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: List Contents
The command scans the folder for:
- All markdown and other files
- Subdirectories and their contents

### Step 2: Extract Descriptions
For each file, it extracts:
- **Markdown files**: The first heading (# Heading) or first sentence
- **Other files**: First line or filename-based description

### Step 3: Build Contents Section
Generates a clean bullet-list format with:
- Filenames in bold
- One-sentence descriptions
- Nested structure for subdirectories

### Step 4: Preview & Confirm
Shows you the proposed changes:

```
📁 Syncing docs/02-practices/README.md
=====================================

Proposed Changes to ## Contents Section:
─────────────────────────────────────────
- **testing.md** – Test strategy, patterns, test infrastructure
- **git-branching.md** – Git workflow, branching strategy, commit conventions
...

Update README.md with these changes? (YES/NO)
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Contents Updated
Run after adding new files to a folder:

```bash
# Just added a new file
vim docs/02-practices/performance-tuning.md

# Update the README
/agileflow:readme-sync FOLDER=docs/02-practices
```

### Pre-Release Checklist
Before major releases, sync all documentation:

```bash
/agileflow:readme-sync FOLDER=all
```

### Quarterly Maintenance
Schedule regular documentation audits:

```bash
# Sync entire docs/ and review changes
/agileflow:readme-sync FOLDER=all
```

### When Reorganizing
After restructuring a folder, immediately sync:

```bash
/agileflow:readme-sync FOLDER=docs/your-folder
```

## What It Updates

The command **only updates the `## Contents` section**:

- Removes old file listings
- Adds all current files with descriptions
- Maintains all other README sections unchanged
- Preserves custom notes and links
- Keeps header, intro, and footer sections intact

This means you can safely use the command without losing custom documentation.

## File Description Extraction

The command intelligently extracts descriptions:

```markdown
# Testing Strategy

Guidelines for writing and running tests...
```

Extracts as: "Testing Strategy – Guidelines for writing and running tests"

```markdown
<!-- This file documents git workflow -->
Guidelines for branching and committing
```

Extracts the first meaningful line as description.
