# AgileFlow Website (Marketing)

This is the marketing landing page (grayscale bento layout).

## Local dev

From repo root:

```bash
npm run dev:website
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deploy to Vercel

In the Vercel project settings, set **Root Directory** to:

```
apps/website
```

Sanity check: the deployed homepage headline should be:

> “Agile delivery, in your repo—powered by AI.”

If you see “AI-Driven Agile Development” and a purple accent, you deployed `apps/docs` instead.
