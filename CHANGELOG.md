# Changelog

All notable changes to the AgileFlow plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-18

### Added

- **`.env.example` template** with comprehensive environment variable documentation
  - NOTION_TOKEN with setup instructions
  - SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY placeholders
  - GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_OWNER, GITHUB_REPO for GitHub sync
  - Clear instructions for obtaining each token type

### Improved

- **Enhanced `/setup-system` MCP detection** - Now properly detects and reports MCP integration status
  - Detects existing `.mcp.json` (not just `.mcp.json.example`)
  - Checks individual MCP servers (Notion, Supabase) and their configuration
  - Reports three-level status: `.mcp.json` config vs `.env.example` vs actual `.env`
  - Granular status reporting: ‚úÖ Configured / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially configured / ‚ùå Missing
  - Offers to add missing environment variables to `.env.example`
  - Updated prompts to handle partial MCP configuration scenarios
  - Better final status summary with detailed MCP integration breakdown
  - Prevents redundant setup prompts when MCP is already configured

### Fixed

- `/setup-system` no longer skips MCP setup when `.mcp.json` already exists
- Environment variable templates now properly documented for all integrations
- Better detection of incomplete MCP setups (config exists but env vars missing)

### Technical

- Updated `commands/setup-system.md` detection phase with improved MCP checks
- Created `.env.example` as committed template (gitignored `.env` for actual secrets)
- Improved status reporting logic for partial configurations
- Added support for detecting multiple MCP servers simultaneously

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-18

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CORRECTION (2025-10-18 - Same Day)

**Initial documentation was incorrect** - OAuth claims were based on a misunderstanding of Notion's MCP documentation.

**CORRECTED APPROACH**:
- Notion MCP uses `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server` package (NOT `mcp-remote`)
- Still requires NOTION_TOKEN in .env (NOT OAuth via /mcp)
- MCP provides **standardized tool interface**, not authentication
- .mcp.json should be gitignored (contains token references)
- .mcp.json.example committed as template for teams

**What Actually Changed in v2.3.0**:
- Uses MCP tools instead of raw Notion API calls
- Better error handling and rate limiting via MCP
- Project-level .mcp.json configuration (in repo root, not ~/.claude-code/)
- Template-based team setup (.mcp.json.example + individual .env files)
- Each team member still needs their own NOTION_TOKEN

**Corrected Files** (same day):
- `.mcp.json` - Fixed to use @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
- `.gitignore` - Added .mcp.json and .env
- `.mcp.json.example` - Created as template
- `commands/setup-system.md` - Removed OAuth, added token-based setup
- `README.md` - Removed OAuth claims, clarified token requirement
- `commands/babysit.md` - Detection still via .mcp.json (correct)
- `agents/agileflow-mentor.md` - Detection still via .mcp.json (correct)

**Apologies for the confusion** - The initial v2.3.0 release incorrectly claimed OAuth support. This correction was made the same day after user testing revealed the error.

### Added

**Notion Integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP)** (CORRECTED):

- Migrated `/notion-export` from direct API calls to MCP tool-based implementation
  - Uses `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server` for standardized tool access
  - Still requires NOTION_TOKEN in .env (token-based, NOT OAuth)
  - MCP provides better error handling and rate limiting
  - Native Claude Code integration with mcp__notion__* tools
  - Project-level .mcp.json configuration (gitignored)
  - .mcp.json.example template for team sharing

- `.mcp.json.example` configuration template
  - Project-scoped MCP server configuration template
  - Committed to git for team sharing
  - Uses env var substitution: ${NOTION_TOKEN}
  - Each team member copies to .mcp.json and adds their own token

- Enhanced `/setup-system` for MCP
  - Interactive Notion integration setup wizard
  - Creates .mcp.json.example template
  - Updates .gitignore to exclude .mcp.json and .env
  - Guides token setup in .env
  - Database creation via MCP tools
  - Team onboarding instructions

**MCP Tools Integration**:

The `/notion-export` command now uses these Notion MCP tools:
- `notion-search` - Find databases in workspace
- `notion-fetch` - Read database/page content
- `notion-create-database` - Set up AgileFlow databases
- `notion-create-pages` - Export stories/epics/ADRs
- `notion-update-page` - Sync changes back to Notion
- `notion-get-users` - Resolve user assignments
- `notion-get-comments` - Fetch discussions (future)
- `notion-get-teams` - Retrieve teamspaces (future)

**GitHub MCP Documentation**:

- Added future GitHub MCP integration notes to `/github-sync`
- Documented advantages of MCP approach vs GitHub CLI
- Current recommendation: Continue using `gh` CLI for stability
- Prepared for future migration when GitHub MCP matures

### Changed

- **Not Breaking** (Corrected): Notion integration still uses NOTION_TOKEN, now via MCP tools
  - Uses @notionhq/notion-mcp-server package instead of direct API calls
  - Token goes in .env (gitignored), referenced in .mcp.json via ${NOTION_TOKEN}
  - .mcp.json is gitignored, .mcp.json.example is template
  - Existing `notion-sync-map.json` files remain compatible
  - Migration guide updated with correct token-based approach

- Updated README with corrected Notion MCP setup instructions
  - Added "Notion Integration (MCP-based)" section (corrected)
  - Team onboarding workflow documented (token-based)
  - Advantages of MCP tool interface over direct API calls

- Enhanced command descriptions
  - `/github-sync` now mentions "uses GitHub CLI"
  - `/notion-export` now mentions "uses MCP"

### Improved

- üîí **Security**: Tokens in .env (gitignored, never committed)
- üë• **Team Collaboration**: Template-based setup (.mcp.json.example + individual tokens)
- üöÄ **Developer Experience**: MCP tools instead of raw API calls (better errors)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Maintenance**: Better error handling and rate limiting via MCP
- üì¶ **Portability**: Project-level .mcp.json config (repo root, not ~/.claude-code/)
- üéØ **Setup Intelligence**: `/setup-system` now detects existing configuration before prompting
  - Shows status summary first (‚úÖ configured / ‚ùå missing / ‚ö†Ô∏è partial)
  - Only asks about features that aren't set up
  - Final output distinguishes already-configured vs newly-created
  - No redundant setup prompts for existing features
  - Better UX for incremental setup and updates

### Migration Guide (Corrected)

For users of AgileFlow v2.2.0 or earlier with existing Notion integration:

**IF YOU ALREADY HAVE NOTION_TOKEN in .env**:
1. Backup sync map: `cp docs/08-project/notion-sync-map.json{,.backup}`
2. Keep your NOTION_TOKEN in .env (still needed!)
3. Set up MCP: Run `/setup-system` and select "yes" for Notion
4. This creates .mcp.json.example and copies to .mcp.json
5. Restart Claude Code (to load MCP server)
6. Verify: Run `/notion-export DRY_RUN=true`
7. Resume syncing: Run `/notion-export`

**IF STARTING FRESH**:
1. Create Notion integration: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Add NOTION_TOKEN to .env
3. Run `/setup-system` and select "yes" for Notion
4. Restart Claude Code
5. Run `/notion-export MODE=setup` to create databases
6. Start syncing!

Your existing database IDs are preserved - no need to recreate databases!
