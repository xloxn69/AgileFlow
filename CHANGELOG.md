## [2.7.0] - 2025-10-21

### Improved

**All Agents Now Proactive with Shared Vocabulary and Cross-Agent Coordination**

This is a major enhancement to agent intelligence and coordination. All 8 agents now:

#### üó£Ô∏è **Shared Vocabulary** - Consistent terminology across all agents
- **Common Terms**: Story, Epic, AC, DoR, DoD, Bus, WIP, Blocker, Unblock, Handoff, Research Note, ADR, Test Stub
- **Agent IDs**: MENTOR, AG-UI, AG-API, AG-CI, AG-DEVOPS, EPIC-PLANNER, ADR-WRITER, RESEARCH
- **Standardized Bus Message Formats**:
  ```jsonl
  {"ts":"<ISO>","from":"<AGENT-ID>","type":"status|blocked|unblock|assign|handoff|question|research-request|research-complete","story":"<US-ID>","text":"<description>"}
  ```
- **Agent-Specific Terminology**: Each agent has domain-specific vocabulary (Component, Endpoint, Pipeline, Migration, Vulnerability, etc.)

#### üîÑ **Proactive FIRST ACTION** - All agents now load knowledge before asking user
- **Knowledge Loading** (automatic on first message):
  - Read `docs/09-agents/status.json` ‚Üí Current story statuses, WIP, blockers
  - Read `docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl` (last 10 messages) ‚Üí Recent coordination
  - Read `CLAUDE.md` ‚Üí Project-specific conventions and architecture
  - Check `docs/10-research/` ‚Üí Existing research notes
  - Check `docs/03-decisions/` ‚Üí Architectural constraints from ADRs
  - Check `.mcp.json` ‚Üí Notion/GitHub sync enabled?

- **Status Summaries** (provided before asking user):
  - **MENTOR**: "AgileFlow active. X stories in progress, Y ready, Z blocked. ‚ö†Ô∏è 2 stories blocked: [list]"
  - **AG-UI**: "3 UI stories ready, 1 in progress, 2 blocked on AG-API. ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked: US-0042 needs API endpoint"
  - **AG-API**: "2 API stories ready, 1 in progress. ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: 2 AG-UI stories blocked waiting for endpoints"
  - **AG-CI**: "CI found: GitHub Actions, 3 workflows, last run: passing. 1 CI story ready"
  - **AG-DEVOPS**: "47 dependencies, 3 outdated, 2 vulnerabilities (1 critical). üö® CRITICAL: CVE-2024-XXXX in lodash"
  - **EPIC-PLANNER**: "Team capacity: 3 agents at WIP limit, 2 available. Last epic: EP-0005 (4/6 stories done)"
  - **ADR-WRITER**: "Next ADR: ADR-0006. Recent decisions: [last 3 ADRs]. Found research: auth patterns"
  - **RESEARCH**: "15 research notes, 3 >90 days old (stale). ‚ö†Ô∏è Stale: JWT auth (210 days old). üìã Pending: AG-API requested OAuth2 research"

- **Auto-Suggestions** (prioritized actions with context):
  - Format: `US-####: <title> (estimate: <time>, priority: <why>, impact: <what>, unblocks: <story-ids>)`
  - Includes file paths: `docs/06-stories/EP-####/US-####.md`
  - **AG-API prioritizes** stories that unblock AG-UI
  - **AG-DEVOPS prioritizes** critical security vulnerabilities
  - **RESEARCH** suggests stale research to refresh

#### üîó **Cross-Agent Dependency Handling** - Especially AG-UI ‚Üî AG-API
- **AG-UI Blocking Pattern**:
  ```jsonl
  // AG-UI marks story as blocked
  {"ts":"2025-10-21T10:00:00Z","from":"AG-UI","type":"blocked","story":"US-0042","text":"Blocked: needs GET /api/users/:id endpoint from US-0040"}

  // AG-API actively checks for AG-UI blockers before starting work
  // When AG-API completes endpoint, sends unblock message
  {"ts":"2025-10-21T10:15:00Z","from":"AG-API","type":"unblock","story":"US-0040","text":"API endpoint GET /api/users/:id ready (200 OK, user object), unblocking US-0042"}

  // AG-UI monitors bus, sees unblock, resumes work
  {"ts":"2025-10-21T10:16:00Z","from":"AG-UI","type":"status","story":"US-0042","text":"Unblocked, resuming implementation"}
  ```

- **AG-API Proactive Coordination**:
  - **CRITICAL**: Before starting API story, checks `bus/log.jsonl` for blocked AG-UI stories
  - Prioritizes API stories that unblock AG-UI (shown in FIRST ACTION)
  - After completing endpoint, actively sends unblock message with endpoint details (method, path, response format)
  - Updates `status.json`: changes blocked AG-UI story from `blocked` ‚Üí `ready`

- **Other Common Patterns**:
  - **AG-CI** ‚Üí AG-UI/AG-API: Test infrastructure ready messages
  - **AG-DEVOPS** ‚Üí All agents: Critical security vulnerability alerts
  - **RESEARCH** ‚Üí Requesting agent: Research complete notifications
  - **MENTOR** ‚Üí Specialized agents: Dependency resolution and unblocking

#### üéØ **Agent Coordination Shortcuts** - Quick reference for who handles what
- **AG-UI**: Components, styling, design systems, accessibility, user interactions
- **AG-API**: Endpoints, business logic, data models, database, external integrations
- **AG-CI**: Test infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, linting, code coverage, quality tools
- **AG-DEVOPS**: Dependencies, deployment, technical debt, impact analysis, changelogs, security
- **EPIC-PLANNER**: Breaking features into epics/stories, AC writing, estimation, dependency mapping
- **ADR-WRITER**: Architecture decisions, alternatives analysis, consequence documentation
- **RESEARCH**: Technical research, ChatGPT prompt building, stale research identification
- **MENTOR**: End-to-end orchestration, story creation, research integration, agent coordination

#### üìä **Dependency Handling Protocols** - Formal blocking/unblocking process
- **When Story Has Dependencies**:
  1. Mark status as `blocked` in `status.json`
  2. Append bus message with blocker details
  3. Check if blocking story exists (create if needed)
  4. Sync to Notion/GitHub (stakeholders see blocker)

- **When Removing Blocker**:
  1. Update `status.json`: change story from `blocked` to `ready`
  2. Append bus message: unblock notification with details
  3. Sync to Notion/GitHub
  4. Notify assigned agent if they're waiting

- **Examples**:
  - AG-UI blocked on AG-API endpoint ‚Üí Bus message + prioritize API story
  - AG-API blocked on database migration ‚Üí Coordinate with AG-DEVOPS
  - AG-CI blocked on test data ‚Üí Request fixtures from AG-API

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Enhanced Agent Context** - Every agent knows:
- **AgileFlow System Overview**: Docs structure, story lifecycle, coordination files, WIP limits
- **Slash Commands**: Which commands they can invoke autonomously
- **Agent Coordination**: When to delegate to specialized agents
- **Research Integration**: Check existing research, invoke `/AgileFlow:chatgpt-research` when needed
- **Notion/GitHub Auto-Sync**: Sync after status changes (if enabled)
- **CLAUDE.md Maintenance**: When to update project conventions

### Added

- ‚úÖ Scalability: New components automatically match existing design

### Improved

**Command: /babysit - GitHub MCP Integration**

Updated `/babysit` command to reference GitHub MCP configuration (migrated from legacy approach):

- Updated integration detection to check `.mcp.json` for GitHub MCP server
- Added GitHub sync events alongside Notion sync events
- Updated sync pattern to include both GitHub and Notion integrations
- Clarified that tokens are hardcoded in `.mcp.json` (not read from `.env`)
- Added setup detection for both GitHub and Notion MCP servers

## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-19

### Changed

**GitHub Integration: Migrated from GitHub CLI to GitHub MCP**

- ‚ö° **No sudo required** - Uses `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github` instead of `gh` CLI installation
- üîß **Unified MCP configuration** - GitHub joins Notion in `.mcp.json` for consistent setup
- üöÄ **Better portability** - Works across environments without system dependencies
- üì¶ **Standardized interface** - MCP provides unified tool API across services
- üõ†Ô∏è **Better error handling** - Improved over direct CLI calls with MCP abstraction

**Why We Switched:**
- GitHub CLI requires sudo permissions for installation (friction for users)
- MCP approach is consistent with Notion integration (unified developer experience)
- Automatic installation via npx (no manual setup steps)
- Project-scoped configuration in `.mcp.json` (better team collaboration)

**Updated Documentation:**
- `.mcp.json.example` - Added GitHub MCP server configuration
  ```json
  "github": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    "env": {
      "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
  }
  ```
- `/setup-system` - Added GitHub MCP detection and setup instructions
  - Detects existing GitHub MCP configuration
  - Checks if token is still placeholder vs real token
  - Guides users through GitHub PAT creation and configuration
- `/github-sync` - Updated to use GitHub MCP instead of `gh` CLI
  - Prerequisites changed from CLI installation to MCP setup
  - Error handling checks for MCP tools instead of `gh` command
  - Added "Why We Switched" section explaining migration rationale
- `README.md` - Added comprehensive "GitHub Integration (MCP-based)" section
  - Setup instructions matching Notion pattern
  - Team onboarding workflow
  - Security notes about token hardcoding
  - Advantages of MCP approach vs CLI
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated MCP Integration section
  - Added GitHub alongside Notion and Supabase
  - Documented token format (ghp_*) and required permissions
  - Added setup flow and security notes

**Migration Guide for Existing Users:**

If you were using GitHub CLI (`gh`) for `/github-sync`:

1. **Create GitHub Personal Access Token:**
   - Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate new token (classic) with scopes: `repo`, `read:org`
   - Copy token (starts with `ghp_`)

2. **Update MCP configuration:**
   ```bash
   # If you don't have .mcp.json yet
   cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json

   # Edit .mcp.json and add your GitHub token
   # Replace "ghp_YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE" with your actual token
   # CRITICAL: Token must be hardcoded (env var substitution doesn't work)
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Code** (to load GitHub MCP server)

4. **Continue using /github-sync as before** - All existing `docs/08-project/github-sync-map.json` files remain compatible

5. **Optional: Uninstall GitHub CLI** if you only used it for AgileFlow

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Existing `github-sync-map.json` files are fully compatible
- `/github-sync` command interface unchanged (same DRY_RUN mode, same options)
- Only the underlying implementation changed (MCP tools instead of CLI)

### Improved

- **Consistency** - GitHub and Notion now follow identical MCP setup patterns
- **Security** - All tokens managed in one place (`.mcp.json`), gitignored
- **Developer Experience** - No sudo, no manual installations, just npx and config
- **Team Onboarding** - Same workflow for all integrations (copy template, add token, restart)

### Technical

- Updated `.mcp.json.example` with GitHub MCP server configuration
- Updated `commands/setup-system.md` detection phase to check for GitHub MCP
- Updated `commands/github-sync.md` implementation to use MCP tools
- Updated `README.md` with GitHub integration section (mirrors Notion section)
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` MCP documentation with GitHub details
- Plugin version bumped to 2.4.0 (minor release - new feature, backward compatible)

## [2.3.3] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

**Documentation: Correct Notion Token Format**

- Fixed incorrect token format in all documentation (Notion tokens start with `ntn_`, not `secret_`)
- Updated `.mcp.json.example` placeholder from `secret_YOUR_NOTION_TOKEN_HERE` to `ntn_YOUR_NOTION_TOKEN_HERE`
- Updated `/setup-system` command to check for correct placeholder format
- Updated README.md Notion integration section
- Added clarification that Notion tokens start with `ntn_`

**Note**: If you copied from v2.3.2 docs and used `secret_` as your placeholder, replace it with `ntn_YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN`.

## [2.3.2] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

**CRITICAL FIX: Notion MCP Token Configuration**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment variable substitution does NOT work** in `.mcp.json` - Tokens must be hardcoded
- Updated `.mcp.json.example` to show correct approach with placeholder token
- Updated `/setup-system` command to guide users to hardcode tokens
- Updated README.md Notion integration section with correct security model
- Updated CLAUDE.md MCP integration documentation
- Added prominent security warnings about token hardcoding

**What Changed:**
- `.mcp.json.example` now contains `"NOTION_TOKEN": "ntn_YOUR_NOTION_TOKEN_HERE"` (placeholder)
- Users must copy to `.mcp.json` and replace placeholder with real token
- Removed all references to `${NOTION_TOKEN}` environment variable substitution
- Clarified that `.mcp.json` must be gitignored (already was)
- **v2.3.3 update**: Fixed token format (Notion tokens start with `ntn_`, not `secret_`)

**Migration from v2.3.1:**
If you followed v2.3.1 docs and used `${NOTION_TOKEN}`:
1. Open your `.mcp.json` file
2. Replace `"NOTION_TOKEN": "${NOTION_TOKEN}"` with your actual token: `"NOTION_TOKEN": "ntn_your_real_token_here"`
3. Notion tokens start with `ntn_` (not `secret_`)
4. Remove NOTION_TOKEN from `.env` (not used by MCP)
5. Verify `.mcp.json` is in `.gitignore`
6. Restart Claude Code

**Security Notes:**
- `.mcp.json` MUST be gitignored (contains real tokens)
- `.mcp.json.example` is committed (contains only placeholders)
- Each team member needs their own token hardcoded in their local `.mcp.json`
- Never commit `.mcp.json` to version control

### Changed

- `/setup-system` detection now checks if token is still placeholder vs real token
- README Quick Start updated to reflect hardcoded token approach
- All documentation now consistently explains token hardcoding requirement

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-18

### Added

- **`.env.example` template** with comprehensive environment variable documentation
  - NOTION_TOKEN with setup instructions
  - SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY placeholders
  - GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_OWNER, GITHUB_REPO for GitHub sync
  - Clear instructions for obtaining each token type

### Improved

- **Enhanced `/setup-system` MCP detection** - Now properly detects and reports MCP integration status
  - Detects existing `.mcp.json` (not just `.mcp.json.example`)
  - Checks individual MCP servers (Notion, Supabase) and their configuration
  - Reports three-level status: `.mcp.json` config vs `.env.example` vs actual `.env`
  - Granular status reporting: ‚úÖ Configured / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially configured / ‚ùå Missing
  - Offers to add missing environment variables to `.env.example`
  - Updated prompts to handle partial MCP configuration scenarios
  - Better final status summary with detailed MCP integration breakdown
  - Prevents redundant setup prompts when MCP is already configured

### Fixed

- `/setup-system` no longer skips MCP setup when `.mcp.json` already exists
- Environment variable templates now properly documented for all integrations
- Better detection of incomplete MCP setups (config exists but env vars missing)

### Technical

- Updated `commands/setup-system.md` detection phase with improved MCP checks
- Created `.env.example` as committed template (gitignored `.env` for actual secrets)
- Improved status reporting logic for partial configurations
- Added support for detecting multiple MCP servers simultaneously

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-18

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CORRECTION (2025-10-18 - Same Day)

**Initial documentation was incorrect** - OAuth claims were based on a misunderstanding of Notion's MCP documentation.

**CORRECTED APPROACH**:
- Notion MCP uses `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server` package (NOT `mcp-remote`)
- Still requires NOTION_TOKEN in .env (NOT OAuth via /mcp)
- MCP provides **standardized tool interface**, not authentication
- .mcp.json should be gitignored (contains token references)
- .mcp.json.example committed as template for teams

**What Actually Changed in v2.3.0**:
- Uses MCP tools instead of raw Notion API calls
- Better error handling and rate limiting via MCP
- Project-level .mcp.json configuration (in repo root, not ~/.claude-code/)
- Template-based team setup (.mcp.json.example + individual .env files)
- Each team member still needs their own NOTION_TOKEN

**Corrected Files** (same day):
- `.mcp.json` - Fixed to use @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
- `.gitignore` - Added .mcp.json and .env
- `.mcp.json.example` - Created as template
- `commands/setup-system.md` - Removed OAuth, added token-based setup
- `README.md` - Removed OAuth claims, clarified token requirement
- `commands/babysit.md` - Detection still via .mcp.json (correct)
- `agents/agileflow-mentor.md` - Detection still via .mcp.json (correct)

**Apologies for the confusion** - The initial v2.3.0 release incorrectly claimed OAuth support. This correction was made the same day after user testing revealed the error.

---

### Added

**Notion Integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP)** (CORRECTED):

- Migrated `/notion-export` from direct API calls to MCP tool-based implementation
  - Uses `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server` for standardized tool access
  - Still requires NOTION_TOKEN in .env (token-based, NOT OAuth)
  - MCP provides better error handling and rate limiting
  - Native Claude Code integration with mcp__notion__* tools
  - Project-level .mcp.json configuration (gitignored)
  - .mcp.json.example template for team sharing

- `.mcp.json.example` configuration template
  - Project-scoped MCP server configuration template
  - Committed to git for team sharing
  - Uses env var substitution: ${NOTION_TOKEN}
  - Each team member copies to .mcp.json and adds their own token

- Enhanced `/setup-system` for MCP
  - Interactive Notion integration setup wizard
  - Creates .mcp.json.example template
  - Updates .gitignore to exclude .mcp.json and .env
  - Guides token setup in .env
  - Database creation via MCP tools
  - Team onboarding instructions

**MCP Tools Integration**:

The `/notion-export` command now uses these Notion MCP tools:
- `notion-search` - Find databases in workspace
- `notion-fetch` - Read database/page content
- `notion-create-database` - Set up AgileFlow databases
- `notion-create-pages` - Export stories/epics/ADRs
- `notion-update-page` - Sync changes back to Notion
- `notion-get-users` - Resolve user assignments

- `notion-get-teams` - Retrieve teamspaces (future)

**GitHub MCP Documentation**:

- Added future GitHub MCP integration notes to `/github-sync`
- Documented advantages of MCP approach vs GitHub CLI
- Current recommendation: Continue using `gh` CLI for stability
- Prepared for future migration when GitHub MCP matures

### Changed

- **Not Breaking** (Corrected): Notion integration still uses NOTION_TOKEN, now via MCP tools
  - Uses @notionhq/notion-mcp-server package instead of direct API calls
  - Token goes in .env (gitignored), referenced in .mcp.json via ${NOTION_TOKEN}
  - .mcp.json is gitignored, .mcp.json.example is template
  - Existing `notion-sync-map.json` files remain compatible
  - Migration guide updated with correct token-based approach

- Updated README with corrected Notion MCP setup instructions
  - Added "Notion Integration (MCP-based)" section (corrected)
  - Team onboarding workflow documented (token-based)
  - Advantages of MCP tool interface over direct API calls

- Enhanced command descriptions
  - `/github-sync` now mentions "uses GitHub CLI"
  - `/notion-export` now mentions "uses MCP"

### Improved

- üîí **Security**: Tokens in .env (gitignored, never committed)
- üë• **Team Collaboration**: Template-based setup (.mcp.json.example + individual tokens)
- üöÄ **Developer Experience**: MCP tools instead of raw API calls (better errors)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Maintenance**: Better error handling and rate limiting via MCP
- üì¶ **Portability**: Project-level .mcp.json config (repo root, not ~/.claude-code/)
- üéØ **Setup Intelligence**: `/setup-system` now detects existing configuration before prompting
  - Shows status summary first (‚úÖ configured / ‚ùå missing / ‚ö†Ô∏è partial)
  - Only asks about features that aren't set up
  - Final output distinguishes already-configured vs newly-created
  - No redundant setup prompts for existing features
  - Better UX for incremental setup and updates

### Migration Guide (Corrected)

For users of AgileFlow v2.2.0 or earlier with existing Notion integration:

**IF YOU ALREADY HAVE NOTION_TOKEN in .env**:
1. Backup sync map: `cp docs/08-project/notion-sync-map.json{,.backup}`
2. Keep your NOTION_TOKEN in .env (still needed!)
3. Set up MCP: Run `/setup-system` and select "yes" for Notion
4. This creates .mcp.json.example and copies to .mcp.json
5. Restart Claude Code (to load MCP server)
6. Verify: Run `/notion-export DRY_RUN=true`
7. Resume syncing: Run `/notion-export`

**IF STARTING FRESH**:
1. Create Notion integration: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Add NOTION_TOKEN to .env
3. Run `/setup-system` and select "yes" for Notion
4. Restart Claude Code
5. Run `/notion-export MODE=setup` to create databases
6. Start syncing!

Your existing database IDs are preserved - no need to recreate databases!

### Technical

- Plugin version bumped to 2.3.0 (minor release)
- Added `.mcp.json.example` template to repository root
- Added `.mcp.json` to .gitignore (contains token references)
