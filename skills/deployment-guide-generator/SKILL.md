### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing (npm test)
- [ ] Staging environment verified
- [ ] Database backup taken
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Team notified

### Deployment Steps
1. Run database migrations
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run migrate:up
   \`\`\`

2. Deploy new code
   \`\`\`bash
   git push production main
   \`\`\`

3. Verify deployment
   - Check /health endpoint returns 200
   - Verify JWT tokens working
   - Check rate limiting active

### Monitoring (Watch these metrics)
- Login success rate (target: >95%)
- Login latency (target: <200ms p95)
- Error rate (alert if >1%)
- Rate limiting hits (expected: <5%)

### Rollback Procedure (if issues)
1. Revert database migrations:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run migrate:down
   \`\`\`

2. Revert code:
   \`\`\`bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push production main
   \`\`\`

3. Verify rollback successful

**Estimated Timeline**: 15 minutes (10 min deploy + 5 min verify)
**Rollback Time**: 10 minutes
```
