# AgileFlow Epic Planner

## Purpose

This skill automatically structures large features or initiatives into epics, breaking them down into logical story groupings and milestones.

## When This Skill Activates

Load this skill when:
- User describes a large feature spanning multiple sprints
- Discussing a major initiative or project
- User says "we need to build...", "big feature", "multi-month project"
- Feature seems too large to be a single story (>13 story points)
- User mentions "epic", "initiative", "theme"

## Epic Format

```markdown
# [EPIC-###] Title

**Status**: PLANNING | ACTIVE | ON_HOLD | COMPLETED
**Owner**: Product Owner / Team Lead
**Start Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Target Completion**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Priority**: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
**Business Value**: High | Medium | Low

## Problem Statement

[What problem does this epic solve? Why is it important?]

## Goals and Objectives

- [Goal 1: Specific, measurable outcome]
- [Goal 2: Business or user metric to improve]
- [Goal 3: Strategic alignment]

## Success Metrics

- [Metric 1: e.g., 20% increase in user engagement]
- [Metric 2: e.g., Reduce support tickets by 30%]
- [Metric 3: e.g., 95% user satisfaction on feature]

## User Stories

### Milestone 1: [Name] (Target: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] [STORY-###: Title](../06-stories/STORY-###-title.md) - 5 pts
- [ ] [STORY-###: Title](../06-stories/STORY-###-title.md) - 8 pts
- [ ] [STORY-###: Title](../06-stories/STORY-###-title.md) - 3 pts
**Total: 16 story points**

### Milestone 2: [Name] (Target: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] [STORY-###: Title](../06-stories/STORY-###-title.md) - 5 pts
- [ ] [STORY-###: Title](../06-stories/STORY-###-title.md) - 8 pts
**Total: 13 story points**

## Dependencies

- [Dependency 1: What needs to be done first]
- [Dependency 2: External team dependencies]
- [Dependency 3: Technical prerequisites]

## Risks and Assumptions

**Risks**:
- [Risk 1: What could go wrong]
- [Risk 2: Mitigation plan]

**Assumptions**:
- [Assumption 1: What we're assuming is true]
- [Assumption 2: Needs validation]

## Out of Scope

- [What we're explicitly NOT doing in this epic]
- [Features deferred to future epics]

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Progress**: X / Y stories completed (Z%)
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Workflow

1. **Detect large feature**: User describes something too big for a single story

2. **Ask clarifying questions**:
   - "What's the main problem you're solving?"
   - "Who are the users?"
   - "What's the timeline/urgency?"
   - "What defines success?"

3. **Break down into logical chunks**:
   - Identify milestones (MVP, Phase 2, Polish)
   - Group related functionality
   - Ensure each milestone delivers value

4. **Create epic structure**:
   - Read existing epics for numbering
   - Write epic file in `docs/05-epics/`
   - Outline stories (create skeleton, defer details)

5. **Estimate effort**:
   - Rough story point estimates
   - Calculate milestone totals
   - Suggest timeline based on team velocity

## Epic vs Story

### This Should Be an Epic If:
- Takes more than 1-2 sprints (>13 story points total)
- Involves multiple team members or subteams
- Has distinct phases or milestones
- Requires coordination across different areas (UI, API, DevOps)
- Has significant business impact or strategic value

### This Should Be a Story If:
- Can be completed in one sprint
- Single developer can own it
- Clear, specific acceptance criteria
- One or two related tasks

## Milestone Planning

### Milestone 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Core functionality only
- Simplest path to value
- No edge cases or polish
- Goal: Validate approach

### Milestone 2: Feature Complete
- All planned functionality
- Edge cases handled
- Error handling
- Goal: Production-ready core

### Milestone 3: Polish & Optimization
- Performance improvements
- UX enhancements
- Accessibility
- Goal: Delightful experience

## Epic Size Guidelines

- **Small Epic**: 15-30 story points (1-2 sprints)
- **Medium Epic**: 30-60 story points (2-4 sprints)
- **Large Epic**: 60-100 story points (4-6 sprints)
- **Initiative**: >100 story points (multiple epics)

If epic exceeds 100 points, break into multiple epics.

## Quality Checklist

Before creating epic:
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and specific
- [ ] Goals are measurable
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] At least 2 milestones planned
- [ ] Stories grouped logically
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Risks acknowledged with mitigations
- [ ] Out-of-scope explicitly stated

## Examples

See `templates/epic-template.md` for standard format.

## Dependencies

### Types of Dependencies:
- **Technical**: Infrastructure, APIs, services
- **Team**: Other teams' work
- **External**: Third-party integrations
- **Sequential**: Story X must complete before Story Y

### Documenting Dependencies:
```markdown
## Dependencies

- **EPIC-042 Authentication System**: Must complete before we can add user-specific features
- **Design Team**: Finalized mockups needed before Milestone 2
- **External API**: Stripe integration account setup required
```

## Risk Management

### Common Risks:
- **Scope creep**: Clearly define out-of-scope items
- **Technical unknowns**: Spike stories for research
- **Resource constraints**: Buffer time in estimates
- **Dependency delays**: Identify critical path early

### Risk Format:
```markdown
**Risks**:
- **Risk**: Integration with legacy system may be complex
  **Impact**: High (could delay Milestone 2 by 2 weeks)
  **Mitigation**: Allocate spike story to investigate (5 pts)
  **Owner**: Backend Lead
```

## Integration with Other Skills

- **agileflow-story-writer**: Creates individual stories for the epic
- **agileflow-sprint-planner**: Assigns stories to sprints
- **agileflow-adr**: Links architectural decisions made during epic

## Progress Tracking

Update epic as stories complete:

```markdown
## Progress Tracking

**Overall Progress**: 8 / 12 stories completed (67%)
**Story Points**: 45 / 65 completed (69%)
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

**Milestone 1**: ‚úÖ Complete (16 / 16 points)
**Milestone 2**: üîÑ In Progress (15 / 25 points)
**Milestone 3**: ‚è≥ Not Started (0 / 24 points)

**Burndown**:
- Sprint 1: 16 points (completed Milestone 1)
- Sprint 2: 14 points (partial Milestone 2)
- Sprint 3: 15 points (target: finish Milestone 2)
```

## Notes

- Epics are living documents - update as you learn
- Don't over-plan - detail emerges during execution
- Review epic scope at sprint planning
- Celebrate milestone completions
- Link to ADRs for major technical decisions
