# Synthesis: Context Engineering

**Type**: Synthesis (cross-research analysis)
**Date**: 2026-01-17
**Files Analyzed**: 3
**Consensus Items**: 5
**Conflicts Found**: 1

## Summary

Cross-document synthesis of context engineering research from 3 files spanning 2026-01-09 to 2026-01-13. Key consensus: progressive disclosure, sub-agent isolation for context control (not roles), and front-loading research into artifacts before implementation. One conflict detected: 40% vs 70% context utilization threshold.

## Consensus Findings (HIGH CONFIDENCE)

These findings appear in 2+ research notes:

### 1. Progressive Disclosure is Critical
**Sources**: 20260109-principles.md, 20260113-coding-agents.md

Reveal only what's needed for the current task. First file calls it "the #1 principle", second recommends progressive disclosure via directory-level CLAUDE.md files.

### 2. Sub-Agents Are for Context Control, Not Roles
**Sources**: 20260109-principles.md, 20260113-coding-agents.md

First file: "background tasks in isolated context windows". Second explicitly warns "NOT for frontend/backend/QA sub-agents" but "for forking context to explore, then returning compressed findings."

### 3. Context Window Has Practical Limits < Advertised
**Sources**: 20260109-principles.md, 20260113-coding-agents.md

First file cites 70% attention budget. Second cites ~40% "dumb zone". **Different thresholds but same principle: effective capacity is much less than advertised.**

### 4. Research Before Implementation (RPI Pattern)
**Sources**: 20260113-coding-agents.md, 20260113-rpi.md

Both emphasize front-loading research into artifacts before coding. First uses Research→Plan→Implement workflow. Second uses Prompt Playbook (Perplexity→spec.md→Claude Code).

### 5. Structured Note-Taking / External Artifacts
**Sources**: 20260109-principles.md, 20260113-coding-agents.md

Both advocate externalizing context to markdown files that survive compaction. "Maintains critical context across compactions."

## Unique Insights (VERIFY)

Findings that appear in only one research note:

| Finding | Source | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| "Dumb Zone" at 40% context | 20260113-coding-agents.md | Newer, more specific than 70% rule - may supersede |
| Leverage Math: Bad research = 100s of bad code lines | 20260113-coding-agents.md | Key insight for prioritizing human review |
| File Format Token Efficiency (YAML > MD > XML > JSON) | 20260109-principles.md | Practical, actionable guidance |
| Prompt Playbook: Perplexity → spec.md → Claude Code | 20260113-rpi.md | Specific workflow pattern |
| Documentation Feeding: @gemini-docs.md pattern | 20260113-rpi.md | Solves training cutoff issues |

## Conflicts Detected (NEEDS REVIEW)

### Context Utilization Threshold

| File | Threshold | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 20260109-principles.md | 70% | "When context exceeds 70% capacity, models struggle" |
| 20260113-coding-agents.md | 40% | "Dumb zone" starts at ~40% for complex brownfield codebases |

**Resolution Suggestion**: Use 40% as target (stay in "smart zone"), 70% as hard limit (mandatory compaction). The 40% threshold may be more conservative for complex work, while 70% works for simpler tasks.
