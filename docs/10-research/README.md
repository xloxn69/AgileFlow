| 2026-01-13 | Context Engineering for Rapid Prototyping | [20260113-context-engineering-rpi.md](./20260113-context-engineering-rpi.md) | Prompt Playbook pattern: use research AI (Perplexity) to generate spec.md BEFORE Claude Code. Documentation feeding: save API docs as .md, use @file tagging. Key: specificity matters - "Use Gemini 3 Flash + @gemini-docs.md" prevents outdated API usage. Caching patterns for AI-generated content. |
| 2026-01-13 | Context Engineering for Coding Agents | [20260113-context-engineering-coding-agents.md](./20260113-context-engineering-coding-agents.md) | Dex's RPI workflow: Research-Plan-Implement with frequent intentional compaction. Key: "dumb zone" starts at ~40% context utilization. Sub-agents for context control, not roles. Leverage math: bad research = 100s of bad code lines. Mental alignment through plan review, not code review. |
| 2026-01-13 | Thread-Based Engineering | [20260113-thread-based-engineering-agentic-workflows.md](./20260113-thread-based-engineering-agentic-workflows.md) | Mental framework for agentic engineering improvement. 6 thread types: Base, P (Parallel), C (Chained), F (Fusion), B (Big/nested), L (Long-running), plus Z (Zero-touch).

| 2026-01-09 | Context Engineering Principles | [20260109-context-engineering-principles.md](./20260109-context-engineering-principles.md) | Core principles for AI coding workflows: progressive disclosure, 70% attention budget rule, file format efficiency (YAML>MD>XML>JSON), sub-agent isolation, structured note-taking. Key: workflows must be project-specific. |
| 2026-01-09 | Ralph Loop + TDD for UI | [20260109-ralph-loop-tdd-ui-workflow.md](./20260109-ralph-loop-tdd-ui-workflow.md) | TDD + Ralph Loop workflow for Shadcn UI development.
