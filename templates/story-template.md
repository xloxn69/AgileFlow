## Architecture Context
<!-- AUTO-FILLED by epic-planner: Extract ONLY relevant architecture sections from docs/04-architecture/ -->
<!-- Include file locations, data models, API endpoints, component specs, testing requirements -->
<!-- Every technical detail MUST cite its source: [Source: architecture/api.md#endpoints] -->

### Data Models & Schemas
<!-- Specific schemas, validation rules, relationships this story uses -->

### API Specifications
<!-- Endpoint details, request/response formats, auth requirements -->

### Component Specifications
<!-- UI component details, props, state management -->

### File Locations & Naming
<!-- Exact paths where new code should be created -->

### Testing Requirements
<!-- Specific test cases, frameworks, patterns from testing-strategy.md -->

### Technical Constraints
<!-- Version requirements, performance considerations, security rules -->

## Technical Notes
<!-- Implementation hints, edge cases, specific approaches to use -->

## Testing Strategy
See: `docs/07-testing/test-cases/{{STORY_ID}}.md`

## Dependencies
