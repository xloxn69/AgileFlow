# =============================================================================
# PREFERENCES
# =============================================================================
# Explicit preferences learned from user corrections.
# Each entry captures: what triggered the learning, what was learned, and confidence.

preferences:
  # Example: High confidence from explicit correction
  # - signal: "User said 'no AI attribution in commits'"
  #   learning: "Never add AI footers or Co-Authored-By lines"
  #   confidence: high
  #   captured: 2026-01-06T10:30:00.000Z

  # Example: Medium confidence from approval
  # - signal: "User approved 'feat(api): add user endpoint'"
  #   learning: "Use conventional commits with scope in parentheses"
  #   confidence: medium
  #   captured: 2026-01-06T11:00:00.000Z

  # Example: Low confidence from observation
  # - signal: "User shortened message from 60 to 45 chars"
  #   learning: "User may prefer shorter commit messages"
  #   confidence: low
  #   captured: 2026-01-06T11:30:00.000Z

# =============================================================================
# CONVENTIONS
# =============================================================================
# Established patterns this skill should always follow.
# These are high-confidence learnings that have been validated.

conventions:
  # - "Use imperative mood in commit subject"
  # - "Keep subject line under 50 characters"
  # - "Separate subject from body with blank line"

# =============================================================================
# ANTI-PATTERNS
# =============================================================================
# Things this skill should never do.
# These are typically from explicit "never do X" corrections.

anti_patterns:
  # - "Don't add emojis unless user explicitly requests"
  # - "Don't use past tense in commit messages"
  # - "Don't include issue numbers without prefix"

# =============================================================================
# CONTEXT
# =============================================================================
# Project-specific context the skill has learned.
# This helps the skill understand the environment it's operating in.

context:
  # project_type: nodejs
  # primary_language: typescript
  # framework: next.js
  # style_guide: conventional-commits

# =============================================================================
# EXAMPLES
# =============================================================================
# Good examples the skill has learned from.
# Can be referenced when generating new output.

examples:
  # good:
  #   - "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow"
  #   - "fix(api): handle null response from external service"
  #
  # bad:
  #   - "Added stuff"  # Too vague
  #   - "fixed bug"    # No scope, past tense
