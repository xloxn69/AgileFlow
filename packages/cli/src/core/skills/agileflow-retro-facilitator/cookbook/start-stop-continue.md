# Start/Stop/Continue Retrospective Format

The standard format for sprint retrospectives. Best for regular, recurring retros.

## Template

```markdown
# Sprint [Number] Retrospective

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Facilitator**: [Name]
**Attendees**: [Team members present]
**Sprint Duration**: [Start] - [End]

## Sprint Metrics

- **Committed**: X story points
- **Completed**: Y story points
- **Velocity**: Z%
- **Stories Done**: A / B
- **Bugs Found**: C

## What Went Well

- [Positive 1: Specific thing that worked]
- [Positive 2: Team success]
- [Positive 3: Process improvement]

## What Didn't Go Well

- [Challenge 1: Specific problem]
- [Challenge 2: Blocker or delay]
- [Challenge 3: Process issue]

## Start (New Practices)

- **[Practice 1]**
  - Why: [Reasoning]
  - Owner: [Who will drive this]
  - Success metric: [How we'll measure]

## Stop (Remove Practices)

- **[Practice 1]**
  - Why it's not working: [Reasoning]
  - Alternative: [What we'll do instead]

## Continue (Keep Doing)

- **[Practice 1]**
  - Why it's working: [Reasoning]
  - How to maintain: [Keep it going]

## Action Items

- [ ] **[Action 1]** - @Owner - Due: [Date]
  - Success criteria: [How we know it's done]

- [ ] **[Action 2]** - @Owner - Due: [Date]
  - Success criteria: [How we know it's done]

## Previous Action Items Review

- [] **[Completed Action]** - Implemented, improved X by Y%
- [] **[In Progress Action]** - Still working on it, 60% done
- [] **[Not Done Action]** - Blocked by Z, rolling to next sprint

## Key Insights

1. [Insight 1: Pattern or learning]
2. [Insight 2: Team dynamic observation]
3. [Insight 3: Process discovery]
```

## Metrics to Track

**Sprint Health**:
- Velocity trend (increasing, stable, decreasing?)
- Commitment accuracy (completed vs committed)
- Bug count (increasing, decreasing?)
- Blocker frequency

**Team Health**:
- Meeting effectiveness
- Communication quality
- Collaboration level
- Work-life balance

**Process Health**:
- Cycle time (story start to done)
- Code review turnaround
- Deployment frequency
- Incident count

## Common Themes to Watch For

**Positive Patterns**:
- Consistent velocity
- Low bug count
- Fast code reviews
- Clear requirements
- Good collaboration

**Warning Signs**:
- Declining velocity
- Recurring blockers
- Communication issues
- Scope creep
- Burnout indicators

## Facilitator Tips

**Do**:
- Create safe space for honest feedback
- Focus on process, not people
- Time-box discussions (5-10 min per topic)
- Ensure everyone participates
- End on positive note
- Follow up on action items

**Don't**:
- Blame individuals
- Let discussions run too long
- Skip retros ("too busy")
- Create action items without owners
- Ignore previous action items

## Remote Retro Adaptations

For distributed teams:
- Use anonymous feedback tools (Retrium, Metro Retro)
- Give time for async reflection before meeting
- Use polls/voting for prioritization
- Record session for absent team members
- Use collaborative docs for brainstorming

## Frequency Guidelines

- **Every sprint**: Standard retros (60-90 min)
- **Major milestones**: Extended retros (2-3 hours)
- **Quarterly**: Big-picture retros (process, tools, culture)
- **Post-incident**: Blameless postmortems (as needed)
