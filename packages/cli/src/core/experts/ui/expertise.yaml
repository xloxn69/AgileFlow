# This file represents the agent's understanding of UI patterns.
# It is populated with AgileFlow-generic knowledge and learns project-specific
# details through the self-improve workflow.

# Component registry
# Self-improve will populate project-specific components
relationships: []
  # Example - will be populated by self-improve:
  # - component: Button
  #   variants: [default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link]
  #   location: src/components/ui/button.tsx
  #   props: [variant, size, asChild]
  # - component: Card
  #   children: [CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, CardFooter]
  #   location: src/components/ui/card.tsx

# UI patterns the expert should recognize and follow
patterns:
  - name: "Component composition"
    description: "Build complex UIs from small, focused components"
    location: All components
    principle: "Single responsibility per component"

  - name: "Props interface"
    description: "TypeScript interface for component props"
    location: Component file top
    convention: "interface ComponentNameProps"

  - name: "forwardRef"
    description: "Forward refs for DOM access and composition"
    location: Base components
    use_case: "When component wraps native element"

  - name: "Styling with Tailwind"
    description: "Utility-first CSS with Tailwind classes"
    location: className prop
    helper: "cn() for conditional classes"

  - name: "Class Variance Authority (CVA)"
    description: "Type-safe component variants"
    location: src/components/ui/
    use_case: "Components with multiple variants"

  - name: "Accessibility"
    description: "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, ARIA attributes"
    location: Interactive components
    requirements: [keyboard-nav, screen-reader, focus-visible]

# Conventions the UI expert should follow
conventions:
  - "Components: PascalCase (Button, UserCard, NavMenu)"
  - "Files: Match component name or kebab-case"
  - "Props: interface <ComponentName>Props"
  - "Styling: Tailwind classes, avoid inline styles"
  - "Icons: Lucide React library (or project-specific)"
  - "State: useState for local, context/store for shared"
  - "Effects: useEffect with proper deps array"
  - "Accessibility: Always include aria-label for icons, role for custom elements"
  - "Testing: React Testing Library, test user interactions"
