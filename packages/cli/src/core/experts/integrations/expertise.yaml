patterns:
  - name: API Client Pattern
    description: "Wrap third-party SDK with custom client for testability"
    location: src/integrations/clients/
    example: |
      class StripeClient {
        constructor(apiKey: string) { ... }
        async createPayment(amount: number) { ... }
      }

  - name: Webhook Handler Pattern
    description: "Validate signature, parse event, handle idempotently"
    location: src/integrations/webhooks/
    example: |
      1. Validate webhook signature
      2. Check if event already processed (idempotency)
      3. Parse and route to handler
      4. Respond 200 immediately

  - name: Retry with Exponential Backoff
    description: "Retry failed external requests with increasing delays"
    location: src/integrations/clients/
    example: "1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays with jitter"

  - name: Circuit Breaker
    description: "Stop calling failing services to prevent cascade failures"
    location: src/integrations/clients/
    example: "Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures"

  - name: Rate Limiting
    description: "Respect external service rate limits"
    location: src/integrations/clients/
    example: "Token bucket or queue-based rate limiting"

conventions:
  - "NEVER hardcode API keys - use environment variables"
  - "ALWAYS validate webhook signatures before processing"
  - "ALWAYS implement retry logic with exponential backoff"
  - "ALWAYS log external service calls (without secrets)"
  - "ALWAYS handle rate limiting gracefully"
  - "Implement idempotency for webhook handlers"
  - "Use circuit breaker for unreliable services"
  - "Mock external services in tests"
  - "Document all required environment variables"
