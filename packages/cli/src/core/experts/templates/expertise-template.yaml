# Expertise Template - Mental Model for {{DOMAIN}} Expert
#
# This file represents the agent's "mental model" of the {{DOMAIN}} domain.
# It is NOT a source of truth - the actual code is always the source of truth.
# This is working memory that helps the agent work faster and more accurately.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this template to experts/{{domain}}/expertise.yaml
# 2. Fill in domain-specific knowledge
# 3. Let the self-improve prompt update it over time
