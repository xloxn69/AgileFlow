- Upcoming Work (next priorities, upcoming milestones)
- Metrics (velocity, completion rate, quality metrics)
- Blockers & Risks (current blockers, risk mitigation)
- Decisions Made (recent ADRs)
- Budget/Resources (sprint capacity, team changes)

**Workflow**:
1. Determine period (this week, last sprint, etc.)
2. Collect data from all 10 sources
3. Calculate metrics and trends

   - *Owner*: AG-API
   - *Status*: Mitigation in progress

2. **Third-party OAuth service downtime** (Low Risk)
   - *Mitigation*: Fallback to email login always available
   - *Owner*: AG-API
   - *Status*: Fallback implemented

---

## 🏗️ Key Decisions Made

### ADR-0015: Use Stripe for payment processing
**Decision**: Selected Stripe over PayPal for payment integration
**Rationale**: Better developer experience, lower fees, excellent documentation
**Impact**: Faster integration, reduced costs

### ADR-0016: Implement JWT-based authentication
**Decision**: Use JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry + refresh tokens
**Rationale**: Stateless, scalable, industry-standard
**Impact**: Simplified auth architecture

---

## 👥 Team Updates

- Team velocity increased 20% this week (improved planning)
- AG-CI agent optimized CI pipeline (reduced build time from 8min → 5min)
- No team changes

---

## 📦 Releases
