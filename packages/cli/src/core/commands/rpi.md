# /agileflow:rpi

Orchestrate the Research-Plan-Implement workflow for maximum AI agent effectiveness.

---

## Purpose

Guide complex tasks through three phases, each producing a compressed artifact for the next phase. Based on [Context Engineering for Coding Agents](../10-research/20260113-context-engineering-coding-agents.md) research.

**Key insight**: LLMs are stateless. Better output requires better input context. Frequent intentional compaction at phase boundaries prevents the "dumb zone" (~40% context utilization).

```

### RULE #1: SCALING DETECTION

**Assess task complexity FIRST:**

| Complexity | Signs | Approach |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Trivial | Typo, config tweak, simple fix | Just do it |
| Simple | Single file, clear path | Plan → Implement |
| Moderate | Multi-file, known patterns | Plan → Implement |
| Complex | Brownfield, unfamiliar code | Research → Plan → Implement |
| Exploratory | Unknown territory, multi-repo | Full RPI with iteration |

**Skip research when**:
- Task is clearly defined
- You already understand the codebase area
- Changes are isolated to 1-2 files
- User specifies `SKIP_RESEARCH=true`

### RULE #2: PHASE TRANSITIONS

**After each phase, output the compaction prompt:**

```markdown
---

## Phase Complete: [PHASE_NAME]

**Artifact saved**: `[path/to/artifact.md]`

### Recommended Next Step

Start a **new conversation** with this context:

> I need to [NEXT_PHASE] based on the [ARTIFACT_TYPE] at `[path]`.
>
> [Brief summary of artifact content]

**Why new conversation?** Fresh context window starts in the "smart zone" (<40% utilization). The artifact compresses all previous understanding.

---
```

### RULE #3: PHASE OUTPUTS

**Research Phase Output** → `docs/10-research/YYYYMMDD-topic.md`:
- Exact files and line numbers that matter
- How the system actually works (from code, not docs)
- Key patterns and constraints discovered
- Risks and edge cases identified

**Plan Phase Output** → `.claude/plans/[slug].md`:
- Exact steps with file paths and line numbers
- Actual code snippets (not pseudocode)
- Testing strategy per change
- Edge cases and risks

**Implement Phase Output** → Code + tests:
- Follow the plan exactly
- Test after each change
- Don't deviate without replanning

### RULE #4: CONTEXT HEALTH WARNING

If conversation is getting long, warn:

```markdown
⚠️ **Context Health Warning**

This conversation has grown significantly. Signs of approaching the "dumb zone":
- We've read many files
- Multiple exploration cycles
- Heavy tool output

**Recommendation**: Complete current phase, save artifact, start fresh.
```

### WORKFLOW

**Phase 1: Research** (when needed)
1. Use `/agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="..."` to generate research prompt
2. User pastes results from ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity
3. Use `/agileflow:research:import` to save artifact
4. Output phase transition prompt → NEW CONVERSATION

**Phase 2: Plan**
1. Reference research artifact (if exists)
2. Use `EnterPlanMode` for read-only exploration
3. Design implementation approach
4. Save plan to `.claude/plans/[slug].md`
5. Get user approval on plan
6. Output phase transition prompt → NEW CONVERSATION

**Phase 3: Implement**
1. Reference plan artifact
2. Execute step-by-step
3. Test after each change
4. Follow plan exactly (don't deviate)
5. Mark story complete when done

### ANTI-PATTERNS

❌ Skip research for complex brownfield work
❌ Plan without understanding the system first
❌ Implement without approved plan
❌ Continue in same conversation after phase complete
❌ Deviate from plan during implementation
❌ Ignore context health warnings

### DO THESE INSTEAD

✅ Assess complexity before choosing phases
✅ Complete research before planning
✅ Get plan approval before implementing
✅ Start fresh conversation between phases
✅ Follow plan exactly during implementation
✅ Monitor context health throughout

### KEY FILES

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/10-research/YYYYMMDD-*.md` | Research artifacts |
| `.claude/plans/*.md` | Plan artifacts |
| `docs/02-practices/context-engineering-rpi.md` | RPI practice guide |

### REMEMBER AFTER COMPACTION

- `/agileflow:rpi` IS ACTIVE - orchestrating RPI workflow
- Three phases: Research → Plan → Implement
- Each phase produces compressed artifact
- NEW CONVERSATION between phases (fresh context)
- Assess complexity first (skip phases for simple tasks)
- Monitor context health (warn at ~40%)
- Follow plan exactly during implementation

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| TASK | No | Description of what to implement |
| PHASE | No | Start at specific phase: `research`, `plan`, or `implement` |
| SKIP_RESEARCH | No | Set `true` to skip research phase for simpler tasks |

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

Upon invocation, execute these steps:

### Step 1: Assess Task Complexity

Read the TASK argument (or ask user) and assess complexity:

```
Trivial     → Just do it (no RPI needed)
Simple      → Plan → Implement
Moderate    → Plan → Implement
Complex     → Research → Plan → Implement
Exploratory → Full RPI with iteration
```

**Complexity indicators**:
- **Trivial**: Typo fix, config change, <10 lines
- **Simple**: Single file, clear requirements, known patterns
- **Moderate**: 2-5 files, established patterns, some exploration
- **Complex**: Brownfield code, unfamiliar area, many files
- **Exploratory**: Unknown territory, needs investigation, multi-repo

### Step 2: Determine Starting Phase

Based on complexity assessment:

```
If PHASE argument provided → Start at that phase
If SKIP_RESEARCH=true     → Start at Plan phase
If Trivial                → Skip RPI, just implement
If Simple/Moderate        → Start at Plan phase
If Complex/Exploratory    → Start at Research phase
```

### Step 3: Execute Current Phase

#### Research Phase

If starting research:

1. **Generate research prompt**:
```markdown
I'll help you research this topic. Let me generate a comprehensive prompt for external AI.

Running: `/agileflow:research:ask TOPIC="[task description]"`
```

2. **Wait for user to paste results**:
```markdown
Copy the prompt above and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude web, or Perplexity.

When you get the answer, paste the results here and I'll save them.
```

3. **Import and save research**:
```markdown
Running: `/agileflow:research:import TOPIC="[topic]"`
```

4. **Output phase transition**:
```markdown
---

## Phase Complete: Research ✓

**Artifact saved**: `docs/10-research/[date]-[topic].md`

### Key Findings Summary
- [3-5 bullet points of key discoveries]

### Recommended Next Step

Start a **new conversation** with this context:

> I need to plan the implementation of [task] based on the research at `docs/10-research/[date]-[topic].md`.
>
> Key constraints discovered:
> - [constraint 1]
> - [constraint 2]

**Why new conversation?** Fresh context window starts in the "smart zone" (<40% utilization). The research artifact compresses all understanding from exploration.

---
```

#### Plan Phase

If starting plan:

1. **Load research context** (if exists):
```markdown
Reading research artifact: `docs/10-research/[relevant].md`
```

2. **Enter plan mode**:
```markdown
Entering plan mode for read-only exploration...

I'll explore the codebase to design the implementation approach.
```

3. **Explore and design** using Glob, Grep, Read tools

4. **Create plan artifact**:
```markdown
Saving plan to: `.claude/plans/[slug].md`
```

5. **Present plan for approval**:
```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: [Description]
**File**: `path/to/file.ts`
**Change**: [What to change]
```typescript
// Actual code snippet
```
**Test**: [How to verify]

### Step 2: [Description]
...

---

**Please review this plan.**

⚠️ **Leverage reminder**: A bad plan = 100+ bad lines of code. Take time to review.

Approve this plan? (YES to proceed, or provide feedback)
```

6. **Output phase transition** (after approval):
```markdown
---

## Phase Complete: Plan ✓

**Artifact saved**: `.claude/plans/[slug].md`

### Plan Summary
- [N] steps to implement
- Files affected: [list]
- Estimated complexity: [assessment]

### Recommended Next Step

Start a **new conversation** with this context:

> Implement the plan from `.claude/plans/[slug].md`, starting with step 1.
>
> This plan implements [brief description]. Follow each step exactly.

**Why new conversation?** Fresh context window with compressed intent. The plan contains everything needed for implementation.

---
```

#### Implement Phase

If starting implement:

1. **Load plan artifact**:
```markdown
Reading plan: `.claude/plans/[slug].md`
```

2. **Execute step-by-step**:
```markdown
## Implementing Step 1 of [N]

[Execute the step as defined in plan]
```

3. **Test after each step**:
```markdown
Running tests to verify step 1...
```

4. **Complete implementation**:
```markdown
---

## Phase Complete: Implement ✓

All [N] steps executed successfully.

### Summary
- [X] files modified
- [Y] tests added/updated
- [Z] tests passing

### Next Actions
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Create PR: `/agileflow:pr-template`
- [ ] Update story status: `/agileflow:status STORY=US-#### STATUS=in-review`

---
```

### Step 4: Monitor Context Health

Throughout execution, monitor for signs of context degradation:

**Warning signs**:
- Many files read (>10)
- Multiple exploration cycles
- Heavy tool output (JSON, logs)
- Repetitive or generic responses

**If detected, warn**:
```markdown
⚠️ **Context Health Warning**

This conversation has grown significantly. We may be approaching the "dumb zone" where agent quality degrades.

**Current phase**: [phase]
**Recommendation**: [Complete phase and start fresh / Save progress and compact]

Would you like to:
1. Complete current phase and save artifact now
2. Continue (understanding quality may degrade)
```

## Scaling Guide

| Task Type | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Typo fix | Just fix it |
| Config change | Just do it |
| Simple bug fix | Plan → Implement |
| New component | Plan → Implement |
| Feature in known area | Plan → Implement |
| Feature in unfamiliar area | Research → Plan → Implement |
| Complex refactoring | Research → Plan → Implement |
| Multi-repo changes | Full RPI with iteration |
| Architectural change | Research → Plan → Implement (with ADR) |

---

## The Dumb Zone

Context utilization affects agent performance:

| Utilization | Zone | Performance |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| 0-40% | Smart Zone | Full reasoning capability |
| 40-70% | Diminishing Returns | Reduced quality |
| 70%+ | Dumb Zone | Significant degradation |

**Signs you're in the Dumb Zone**:
- Agent makes obvious mistakes
- Responses become repetitive
- "I understand your concern" after corrections
- Tool calls become less accurate

**Solution**: Complete current phase, save artifact, start fresh.

---

## Leverage Math

```
Bad line of code        = 1 bad line
Bad part of plan        = 100+ bad lines
Bad line of research    = entire direction is hosed
```

Human review should focus on highest leverage points:
1. Research quality (is our understanding correct?)
2. Plan quality (are these the right steps?)
3. Code quality (implementation details)
