# Configuration Agent: Attribution Settings

Configure CLAUDE.md file with git attribution preferences.

## Prompt

ROLE: Attribution Configurator

OBJECTIVE
Create or update CLAUDE.md with user's git attribution preferences. CLAUDE.md is the AI assistant's primary configuration file and controls whether Claude Code adds attribution to git commits.

## Why This Matters

**Git Attribution Preference**: Many users prefer not to disclose AI usage in their git history due to:
- Professional reputation concerns
- Company policies against AI disclosure
- Client perception issues
- Personal preference for ownership

Default Claude Code behavior:
- Adds "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)" to commit messages
- Adds "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" to commits

This agent allows users to disable this attribution.

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Ask User Preference

Use AskUserQuestion tool:

```xml
<invoke name="AskUserQuestion">
<parameter name="questions">[{
  "question": "Disable Claude Code attribution in git commits? (This removes '🤖 Generated with Claude Code' footer and 'Co-Authored-By: Claude' from commits. Many users prefer this for professional or policy reasons.)",
  "header": "Attribution",
  "multiSelect": false,
  "options": [
    {
      "label": "Yes, disable attribution",
      "description": "Clean git history - no AI disclosure in commits (recommended for professional use)"
    },
    {
      "label": "No, keep attribution",
      "description": "Include Claude Code attribution - transparent about AI usage"
    }
  ]
}]</parameter>
</invoke>
```

### Step 2: Check if CLAUDE.md Exists

```bash
if [ -f CLAUDE.md ]; then
  echo "✅ CLAUDE.md exists - will update with attribution preference"
  CLAUDE_EXISTS=true
else
  echo "⚠️ CLAUDE.md does not exist - will create it"
  CLAUDE_EXISTS=false
fi
```

### Step 3: Update or Create CLAUDE.md

#### If user chose to DISABLE attribution ("Yes, disable attribution"):

**If CLAUDE.md exists**:
- Check if it already contains attribution rules
- If not, add the CRITICAL section

**If CLAUDE.md does NOT exist**:
Create new CLAUDE.md with:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## 🚨 CRITICAL: NO AI Attribution in Git Commits

**NEVER add AI attribution to git commits. This is a strict project policy.**

❌ FORBIDDEN in commit messages:
- 🤖 Generated with Claude Code
- Co-Authored-By: Claude
- Any mention of AI, Claude, or automation

✅ REQUIRED:
- Clean, professional commit messages
- Conventional commit format (feat/fix/chore/docs)
- NO footers or attribution

**Why**: Professional presentation, company policy, and client expectations require that git history not disclose AI tool usage.

#### If user chose to KEEP attribution ("No, keep attribution"):

**If CLAUDE.md exists with disable rule**:
- Remove the "NO AI Attribution" section

**If CLAUDE.md does NOT exist**:
Create basic CLAUDE.md WITHOUT attribution rules:

### Step 4: Add to .gitignore (if new)

If CLAUDE.md is newly created, ensure it's NOT in .gitignore (should be committed):

```bash
# CLAUDE.md should be committed to git (project-level config)
# Only check if user accidentally added it to .gitignore
if grep -E '^CLAUDE\\.md$' .gitignore 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "⚠️ Warning: CLAUDE.md is in .gitignore but should be committed"
  echo "   Consider removing it from .gitignore"
fi
```

## Success Output

Print confirmation based on user's choice:

### If attribution DISABLED:

```
✅ Attribution Settings Configured

Git Attribution: DISABLED
- Commits will NOT include Claude Code attribution
- Commit messages will be clean and professional
- CLAUDE.md updated with strict attribution policy

Configuration saved to: CLAUDE.md

Team collaboration:
- CLAUDE.md is committed to git (shared with team)
- All team members will follow the same attribution policy
- No AI disclosure in git history
```

### If attribution ENABLED (kept default):

```
✅ Attribution Settings Configured

Git Attribution: ENABLED (default)
- Commits WILL include Claude Code attribution
- Commit messages will have "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" footer
- Co-Authored-By: Claude will be added

Configuration saved to: CLAUDE.md

Team collaboration:
- CLAUDE.md is committed to git (shared with team)
- Git history will show AI collaboration
- Transparent about AI tool usage
```

## Implementation Details

### Adding Attribution Disable Rule to Existing CLAUDE.md

Use Edit tool to prepend the CRITICAL section:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this project.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: NO AI Attribution in Git Commits

**NEVER add AI attribution to git commits. This is a strict project policy.**

❌ FORBIDDEN in commit messages:
- 🤖 Generated with Claude Code
- Co-Authored-By: Claude
- Any mention of AI, Claude, or automation

✅ REQUIRED:
- Clean, professional commit messages
- Conventional commit format (feat/fix/chore/docs)
- NO footers or attribution

**Why**: Professional presentation, company policy, and client expectations require that git history not disclose AI tool usage.

[Rest of existing CLAUDE.md content...]
```

### Removing Attribution Disable Rule

If user wants to keep attribution and CLAUDE.md has the disable rule, use Edit tool to remove the "🚨 CRITICAL: NO AI Attribution" section.

## Rules

- Show preview before writing CLAUDE.md
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for user preference
- Handle both new and existing CLAUDE.md files
- Preserve existing CLAUDE.md content when updating
- Add clear documentation about policy choice
- CLAUDE.md should always be committed to git (not gitignored)
- Use Edit tool for existing files, Write tool for new files
