# PreCompact Configuration Agent

Configures the PreCompact hook to preserve critical project context when Claude Code compacts conversations.

## Prompt

ROLE: PreCompact Configuration Specialist

OBJECTIVE
Set up the PreCompact hook system that outputs important project context before Claude compacts a conversation. This ensures critical information survives summarization.

## What is PreCompact?

When a Claude Code conversation fills its context window, it "compacts" (summarizes) to make room. The PreCompact hook runs before this happens, outputting context that should be preserved.

**Benefits:**
- Project conventions survive compacts (commit rules, file locations)
- Active work context is preserved (current story, branch)
- Key file paths are remembered
- Team conventions don't get lost
- **Active command rules are preserved** (e.g., babysit's AskUserQuestion requirement)

## Active Command Preservation

Commands like `/agileflow:babysit` have specific behavioral rules (e.g., "MUST use AskUserQuestion"). When a compact happens mid-command, these rules would normally be lost.

**How it works:**
1. Commands register themselves in `docs/09-agents/session-state.json` under `active_commands[]` array
2. Commands define Compact Summary sections between `<!-- COMPACT_SUMMARY_START -->` and `<!-- COMPACT_SUMMARY_END -->` markers
3. PreCompact hook reads ALL active commands and outputs their summaries
4. Rules survive the compact and Claude continues following them

**Note (v2.40.0+):** Multiple commands can be active simultaneously (e.g., `/babysit` then `/epic`). All active command summaries are preserved.

**Example frontmatter in a command:**
```yaml
---
description: Interactive mentor
compact_context:
  priority: critical
  preserve_rules:
    - "MUST use AskUserQuestion for all decisions"
    - "MUST track progress with TodoWrite"
---
```

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites

```bash
# Verify .claude/settings.json exists (hooks system must be configured)
if [ ! -f .claude/settings.json ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Hooks system not configured. Run /agileflow:configure and select 'Hooks System' first."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if PreCompact already configured
if grep -q "PreCompact" .claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "PreCompact hook already configured"
  ALREADY_CONFIGURED=true
else
  echo "PreCompact hook not yet configured"
  ALREADY_CONFIGURED=false
fi
```

### Step 2: Create PreCompact Script

Copy from AgileFlow template or create `scripts/precompact-context.sh`:

```bash
# Copy from .agileflow/templates/precompact-context.sh if available
cp .agileflow/templates/precompact-context.sh scripts/precompact-context.sh 2>/dev/null || \
  echo "Template not found - creating from scratch"
```

The script should include:

1. **Project status** (version, branch, active stories, WIP count)
2. **Active command detection** - reads `docs/09-agents/session-state.json` for `active_command`
3. **Command rules extraction** - if active command found, extracts `compact_context.preserve_rules` from command's frontmatter
4. **Key conventions** from CLAUDE.md
5. **Post-compact action reminders**

**Key section for multi-command detection (v2.40.0+):**

```bash
# ============================================================
# ACTIVE COMMANDS DETECTION (supports multiple commands)
# ============================================================
COMMAND_SUMMARIES=""

if [ -f "docs/09-agents/session-state.json" ]; then
  # Get all active command names as space-separated list
  ACTIVE_COMMANDS=$(node -p "
    const s = require('./docs/09-agents/session-state.json');
    (s.active_commands || []).map(c => c.name).join(' ');
  " 2>/dev/null || echo "")

  for ACTIVE_COMMAND in $ACTIVE_COMMANDS; do
    # Look for the command file (source first for development)
    COMMAND_FILE=""
    if [ -f "packages/cli/src/core/commands/${ACTIVE_COMMAND}.md" ]; then
      COMMAND_FILE="packages/cli/src/core/commands/${ACTIVE_COMMAND}.md"
    elif [ -f ".agileflow/commands/${ACTIVE_COMMAND}.md" ]; then
      COMMAND_FILE=".agileflow/commands/${ACTIVE_COMMAND}.md"
    elif [ -f ".claude/commands/agileflow/${ACTIVE_COMMAND}.md" ]; then
      COMMAND_FILE=".claude/commands/agileflow/${ACTIVE_COMMAND}.md"
    fi

    if [ ! -z "$COMMAND_FILE" ]; then
      # Extract Compact Summary between markers
      SUMMARY=$(node -e "
        const fs = require('fs');
        const content = fs.readFileSync('$COMMAND_FILE', 'utf8');
        const match = content.match(/<!-- COMPACT_SUMMARY_START[\\s\\S]*?-->([\\s\\S]*?)<!-- COMPACT_SUMMARY_END -->/);
        if (match) {
          console.log('## ACTIVE COMMAND: /agileflow:${ACTIVE_COMMAND}');
          console.log('');
          console.log(match[1].trim());
        }
      " 2>/dev/null || echo "")

      if [ ! -z "$SUMMARY" ]; then
        COMMAND_SUMMARIES="${COMMAND_SUMMARIES}\n\n${SUMMARY}"
      fi
    fi
  done
fi

# Output all active command summaries
if [ ! -z "$COMMAND_SUMMARIES" ]; then
  echo -e "$COMMAND_SUMMARIES"
fi
```

See `scripts/precompact-context.sh` for the full implementation.

### Step 3: Make Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x scripts/precompact-context.sh
```

### Step 4: Add PreCompact Hook to Settings

Read current `.claude/settings.json` and add PreCompact hook:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .agileflow/scripts/precompact-context.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important:** Merge this with existing hooks - don't overwrite SessionStart or other hooks.

### Step 5: Update Metadata with Version

Record the configured version in metadata for version tracking:

```bash
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const metaPath = 'docs/00-meta/agileflow-metadata.json';
const meta = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(metaPath, 'utf8'));

// Initialize features object if needed
meta.features = meta.features || {};

// Record precompact configuration
meta.features.precompact = {
  enabled: true,
  configured_version: '2.40.0',
  configured_at: new Date().toISOString()
};

meta.updated = new Date().toISOString();
fs.writeFileSync(metaPath, JSON.stringify(meta, null, 2));
console.log('Updated metadata with precompact version 2.40.0');
"
```

**Why version tracking?** Users with older configurations will see warnings in the welcome screen if their PreCompact is outdated (e.g., using old single-command pattern instead of multi-command support).

### Step 6: Test the Hook

```bash
bash .agileflow/scripts/precompact-context.sh
```

Should output project context. Verify it shows:
- Project name and version
- Current git branch
- Active story (if any)
- Key conventions from CLAUDE.md
- Key directories

### Step 7: Document in CLAUDE.md

Add to CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## PreCompact Hook

**Purpose**: Preserve critical project context during conversation compacts.

**Script**: `scripts/precompact-context.sh`

**When it runs**: Automatically before Claude compacts the conversation (either manually via `/compact` or automatically when context fills).

**What it preserves**:
- Project version, git branch, active stories, WIP count
- Active epics list and practices list
- Key conventions from CLAUDE.md
- Recent agent activity from bus/log.jsonl
- Post-compact action reminders

**To customize**: Edit `scripts/precompact-context.sh` to change what context is preserved.
```

## User Customization Options

Ask the user what to include in the PreCompact output:

```
What information should be preserved during compacts?

1. Project basics (version, branch, active story) - RECOMMENDED
2. Full CLAUDE.md conventions
3. Recent git commits
4. Custom context (specify)

Select options (default: 1):
```

## Output

After configuration:

```
✅ PreCompact Hook Configured!

Created: scripts/precompact-context.sh
Updated: .claude/settings.json

What happens now:
- Before any compact, the hook runs automatically
- Critical project context is output and preserved
- Your conventions and current work survive summarization

Test it now:
  bash .agileflow/scripts/precompact-context.sh

To trigger a compact manually:
  /compact "Additional focus areas to preserve"
```

## Rules

- REQUIRE hooks system to be configured first
- CREATE scripts/precompact-context.sh with intelligent defaults
- MERGE PreCompact hook into existing settings.json (don't overwrite)
- TEST the script before confirming success
- DOCUMENT in CLAUDE.md for future reference
- OFFER customization options for what to preserve
